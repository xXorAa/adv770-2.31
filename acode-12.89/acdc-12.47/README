                        A-code to ANSI C translator
                               Version 12.47
                     =================================

 The acdc translator converts A-code source of an adventure game into ANSI C
 source (.acd -> .c == acdc :-)). The derived C source files (the adv<nn>.c
 and adv<n>.h, where 'n' is a digit) need to be compiled and linked with the
 supplied adventure kernel sources (adv00.c, adv01.c and adv0.h) into an
 executable game.

 Please see the supplied PDF A-code documentation for ways of using the
 translator, be it directly or indirectly via the advbld script.

 The NEWS file contains details of acdc changes in this version.
