FRAGMENT REST.AWHILE
    "Rest awhile, oh Wanderer, whilst thine Dungeon is initialising,
    and contemplate the Imperfection of all Things. For the World
    thou art intent upon entering be Imperfection Incarnate. Thou
    shalt do well to temper thine Anger and cultivate thine Virtue

    Chaos are not yet victorious..."
#
TEXT SPIEL

    With a clear metallic chime, everything around you dissolves
    into grey nothingness. As you peer about, groping with your
    confused mind for some distinct form or feature, there is about
    you a sudden swirl of faint pale colours accompanied by a
    glass-like tinkling, and a dusty voice breathes wearily into
    your ear:

    {REST.AWHILE}

    With that the voice passeth away, leaving you alone in the
    midst of Greyness, formless and boundless beyond all Measure.

    Which is not really as expected, but life is full of surprises and
    Superior Beings will have their Little Jokes. I suggest you do as
    instructed, so that we can get out of here without delay and get
    down to Ye Actual Adventuring.

TEXT increment BAD.OMEN
    [Stuck already? Hmm... Not a good omen. Well,
    you can always try typing VOCAB, if you are new to this
    adventuring thing.

    said? A mistake, but fortunately for you, I have an excellent memory.
    The exact words were/Your memory isn't exactly wonderful, is it?

    is obviously still required./We've already established that resting
    is not quite what is needed here./Right line of reasoning - wrong

#
TEXT LETS.START
    Realising that there is nothing for it, you follow the dusty
    voice's advice and spend some time in deep contemplation. 

    And it seems to be working! Slowly, ever so slowly, the misty 
    greyness begins to coalesce into new (or is it old?) Shapes 
    and Meanings. Eventually you find that:

#
TEXT STUCK.IN.NOWHERE

    Loitering around here may be your idea of fun, but let's get on with
    adventuring. Or are you just too proud to do as instructed?
#
TEXT increment ORIENTAL.DRAWING
    It's just ordinary ancient oriental cave drawings[ of no conceivable
    interest to a mere adventurer like you/].
#
TEXT INTRO
    Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
    treasure and gold, though it is rumoured that some who enter are never
    seen again. Magic is said to work in the cave.

    I will be your eyes and hands. Direct me with commands of 1 or 2
    words, such as WEST, or ENTER, or GET LAMP... (Type INFO for more
    information about commands you can use.) Please don't try using
    longer commands, or I'll get all confused. Most words I know can be
    abbreviated, usually to three or four characters, and there are
    some special one-letter abbreviations, such as W for WEST, G for
    GET, L for LOOK (or EXAMINE), and so on. (But magic words cannot be
    abbreviated at all, of course.) Use the VOCABULARY (or just VOC)
    command for more info and for a list of words I know.

    Should you get stuck, typing HELP may result in some hints.
    Other generally useful commands are SAVE, RESTORE, MEMORIZE, RECALL
    (memory save and restore) and QUIT.

#
FRAGMENT BIRD.HINT
    Are you trying to catch the bird?_
#
TEXT
    For some reason the bird is frightened right now and won't let you
    anywhere near it. This may not sound very unusual, but believe
    me, this particular bird can be quite friendly and tame. I am no avian
    psychologist, but I'd say there must be some specific reason
    for its behaviour.

    head several times, and then flies back to land at your feet and begins
    to sing./
    {BIRD.HOPS.OUT}, attacks the basilisk, and in an astounding flurry
    succeeds in awakening it. The basilisk glares at the bird, causing the
    it to explode into a cloud of fine sand, and then turns and stares
    balefully at you, turning you into a pillar of fine marble suitable for
    decorative lawn or garden use./
    {BIRD.HOPS.OUT}, attacks the spider and in an astounding flurry gets

    [Good try, but/Well, OK, but/Nah../Seriously,] that's a worn out,

#
TEXT HELP.DATA
    Imagine that you are somewhere else (far, far away, in a strange land
    of magic and wonder). As your guide, I will describe to you your
    surroundings while you tell me what you want to do next. For example,
    to move, try words like ENTER (and EXIT), EAST (or E for short), NORTH
    (or N), SOUTHWEST (or SW), UP (or U) etc. (You don't have to say
    GO EAST etc., just the direction will do). Words like DOWNSTREAM,
    CLIMB, CROSS may also come handy. Some other useful commands
    are INVENTORY (or I), LOOK (or L, or EXAMINE, or X), SCORE, INFO,
    VOCABULARY etc.

    In addition to the special abbreviations (like I for Inventory), all
    words, other than magic ones, can be abbreviated to the shortest
    unambiguous length. READ, for instance, can be shortened to REA but
    not RE, since it would clash with REMOVE. Generally you will find that
    most words abbreviate to three or four characters.

    Objects can be manipulated using some of the verbs that I know.
    Usually you have to give both the object and the verb (in either
    order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone - e.g.
    both LIGHT (or ON) and EXTINGUISH (or OFF) imply LAMP. Some objects
    have side-effects; for instance, rods scare birds.
#
TEXT HELP.DATA.END
    Remember that I only understand commands of one or two words. Novice
    players often type commands like THROW AXE AT DWARF. Use THROW AXE
    instead, and I'll do my best to work out where you want to throw it.
    Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are
    attempting something beyond their (or my) capabilities and should try
    a completely different tack.

    To speed up the game you can sometimes move long distances with a
    single word. For example BUILDING usually gets you to the building
    from most places above ground except when lost in the forest.
    Outside the cave you can generally go anywhere you like, unless the
    description gives a reason why you can't do so (e.g. there
    is a cliff in the way!). Within the cave you can generally only move
    in directions explicitly noted as possible exits in the description.
    Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, so that leaving a room to the
    north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.

    Finally, it is worth remembering that I mostly mean just what I say.
    On the other hand, do not assume that everything to be seen or found
    in the Colossal Cave has any particular purpose, even though most
    things and beings do have one (or more).

    looking elsewhere for the keys.
#
TEXT IN.FOREST
    The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
    occasional grove of pine or spruce. There is quite a bit of
    undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings as well as nondescript

#
TEXT INFO.FIRST
    This is Mike Arnautov's 770 point version of the one and only Adventure
    (type HISTORY for a brief summary of its development, and CREDITS for
    acknowledgements). The game now has 475 locations, masses of snide
    remarks (well over 500Kb of text altogether) and a vocabulary of
    over 1000 words.

    Command format is generally verb/noun, but you can specify several
    objects with a single verb: e.g. GET KEYS AND LAMP picks up both,
    but it still counts as two turns. Commas can be used in place
    of ANDs to save typing. If you are lazy, GET ALL and DROP
    ALL also work, again taking the appropriate number of turns, as do
    GET TREASURE and DROP TREASURE - all of these may be followed by
    EXCEPT and a list of objects to be excepted. You can also use IT 
    (or THEM) to refer to the last object mentioned by you, or to the 
    single object listed in the location description, or in your inventory.
    Some words (A, AN, THAT, THE, THIS...) are ignored, making GET THE AXE
    a legal command. Some verbs (e.g. GET) do not need a noun, provided
    there is only one suitable object.

    You can chain commands with full stops or with semicolons (e.g.
    THROW AXE.GET AXE). The special verb REPEAT (or R) can be used to
    repeat the previous command line, or, when embedded in a longer
    command sequence, the previous command in the sequence.
#
TEXT
    All words can be abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous length.
    In addition, the usual special abbreviations exist (E for EAST,
    SE for SOUTHEAST, U for UP...). Some additional abbreviations
    are G or T for GET (or TAKE), DR or DROP, X
    for EXAMINE (or LOOK), TH for THROW and I for INVENTORY.

    If you want to end your adventure early, say Q (or QUIT). To
    suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say SAVE
    \<name\> (or PAUSE or SUSPEND), where \<name\> is the name by 
    which you wish this particular game dump to be known (it must 
    be a single word). To re-start your game at a later time, start
    up a new one and say RESTORE \<name\>. If you forget to specify 
    the name, the game will prompt you for it. And, of course,
    there is REMEMBER and RECALL for memory save/restore.

    To see how well you're doing, say SCORE. To get full credit for
    a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though
    you get partial credit just for locating it. There are also
    points based on your achievements; in particular, there is a
    large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners
    from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine
    whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.
    You lose points for getting killed and for accepting hints.
#
TEXT
    When exploring outside the cave, don't assume that you can only
    move in directions actually mentioned in the description of the
    current location. This assumption may be generally true
    within the cave, but outside you can try going in any direction
    not obviously precluded by the description (e.g. in a deep 
    ravine you can probably only move along the ravine).

    If you think you've got all the treasures in the building, just
    keep exploring the cave for a while. If nothing interesting
    happens, you haven't collected them all yet. If something
    interesting *does* happen, it means you're getting a bonus and
    have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's
    section.

    Do remember to examine things. Even where this is not essential,
    my responses may sometimes suggest particular properties or
    limitations of objects you find in the cave. If you seem to be
    having trouble, I may occasionally offer hints. If I do, I'll
    warn you in advance how much it will affect your score.
#
TEXT INFO.LAST
    Some descriptions contain details which are mere window-dressing. 
    You can usually tell if this is the case by trying words I use in
    descriptions. I can often tell you what is or is not just scenery,
    but if I don't know the words or am obviously misunderstanding them,
    it is safe to assume that such features cannot be in fact manipulated
    and that you would be wasting your time trying to do so.

    Finally, I will not normally repeat the full description of a
    place after the first time unless you explicitly ask me to by
    saying LOOK. You can instruct me always to give the full
    description by typing VERBOSE. On the other hand, if you are an
    experienced adventurer, you may wish to suppress long
    descriptions altogether by specifying TERSE. In the TERSE mode I
    will never under any circumstances give the full description of a
    place. You can always revert to the normal mode of operation by
    saying NORMAL.

    And, by the way, all adventurers are assumed to speak Dwarvish!

TEXT HISTORY.DATA
    The following is a brief history of this game.

    1. Original Adventure developed by Will Crowther.
   
    2. Greatly enhanced and expanded to the 350 pt version by Don Woods.
   
    3. Adventure II superset (440 pt, later known as Adv440) produced
       by Peter Luckett and Jack Pike.
   
    4. Adventure 3 (550 pt, hence known as Adv550) - a different superset
       and game language (A-code) developed by Dave Platt.
   
    5. The two supersets combined (with extensions) by Mike Arnautov,
       using DP's A-code into Adventure4+ (660pt), also known as Adv660.
   
    6. Adventure4+ further extended by popular demand into this 770 pt
       version by Mike Arnautov.

    magical wall of the pentagram (which holds), and nods politely to you.
    "MY THANKS, OH MORTAL," he says in an incredibly deep bass voice. "IT
    HAS BEEN THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE SOLOMON SEALED ME INTO THAT BOTTLE,
    AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE RELEASED ME. IF YOU WILL OPEN THIS
    PENTAGRAM AND LET ME GO FREE, I WILL GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE THAT YOU MAY
    ONE DAY WISH TO POSSESS."
#
TEXT RUDE.DJINN
    The flask's wax seal crumbles at your touch. A large cloud of black
    smoke pours out, solidifying into the form of a twelve-foot Djinn. "AT
    LAST!" he says in an earth-shaking voice, "I KNEW THAT SOMEDAY SOMEONE
    WOULD RELEASE ME! I WOULD REWARD YOU FOR THIS, MORTAL, BUT IT HAS BEEN
    THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE I HAD A SOLID MEAL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO
    STAND HERE CHATTERING WHEN I COULD BE OUT EATING A SIX-INCH SIRLOIN
    STEAK. FAREWELL." With that, he somewhat rudely explodes back into
    smoke and drifts quickly out of sight.

    That, if I may say so, was unwise. Or, to use a more technical term,
    you blew it. Hope you have a recently saved game.
#
TEXT DJINN.ADVICE
    The pentagram's magical barrier sparks fitfully and goes down. The
    Djinn stretches gratefully and smiles at you. "AGAIN, MY THANKS," he
    says. "MY ADVICE TO YOU WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A HISTORY LESSON. WHEN
    RALPH WITT, THE ARCHITECT AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THIS CAVE, WAS VERY YOUNG,
    HE BECAME VERY INCENSED THAT HIS NAME WAS AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET.
    HE FELT (FOR SOME REASON) THAT THE LETTER W BELONGED NEAR THE BEGINNING
    OF THE ALPHABET, AND THAT ALL OF THOSE "UPSTART LETTERS WHICH UNFAIRLY
    USURPED THE BEST PLACES" SHOULD BE FORCED INTO EXILE AT THE END OF THE
    ALPHABET. HIS INSTINCT FOR MATTERS MAGICAL AND MYSTICAL LED HIM TO
    APPLY THIS STRANGE BELIEF INTO THE CAVE'S STRUCTURE WHEN HE EXCAVATED
    IT. YOU HAVEN'T YET BEEN AFFECTED BY HIS STRANGE HABITS, BUT YOU
    SHOULD REMEMBER THIS. FAREWELL, AND GOOD LUCK." With that, the Djinn
    evaporates into a cloud of smoke and drifts rapidly away.

    incredible orgy of grinding destruction, and the cave walls fall and

    You are lying, badly mangled, on a small rock island in a sea of molten

TEXT random CAMEO

    [From somewhere in the distance, there comes a musical skirl of light,
    elvish laughter and the sounds of merriment./
    From somewhere nearby, there suddenly comes a sound of something
    mechanical in motion. As you turn towards it, an incredible figure
    rolls into the light of your lamp. It stands about five feet high on a
    wheeled metal pedestal, and has a globular light-filled head,
    accordion-pleated metal arms, and a cylindrical body the size of an oil
    drum with a plastic panel on the front. It rolls past without taking
    any notice of you, all the while waving its arms, flashing a light
    behind its front panel and bellowing "WARNING! WARNING! DANGER!" at
    the top of its not inconsiderable voice. It rolls on out of sight, and
    moments later there is an immense flash of light and a tremendous blast
    of sparks and smoke. When the air clears, you find that no trace
    remains of the strange apparition./
    All of a sudden you hear the rapidly approaching sound of many
    running footsteps. You barely have the time to press yourself
    against a nearby wall, when a massive wooden trunk on many
    furiously pumping feet, dashes past you at high speed and
    disappears in the darkness./
    With a sudden gust of air, a large cave bat flutters into view, flies
    around your head several times, squeaks with disgust, and flutters on
    out of sight./
    Suddenly, the ground quivers underfoot; a dull rumbling sound resounds
    from the rock around you, and in the distance you can hear the crash of
    falling rock. The earth tremor subsides after a few seconds without
    causing any major damage./
    From the darkness nearby comes the sound of shuffling feet. As you
    turn towards the sound, a nine-foot cyclops ambles into the light of
    your lamp. The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of worsted
    wool, and is wearing a black silk top-hat and cowboy boots and is
    carrying an ebony walking-stick. It catches sight of you and stops,
    seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in
    amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock. After staring
    at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into the
    pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with a
    leafy green substance, and examines it carefully. "It must be worth
    eighty pazools an ounce after all" mumbles the cyclops, who casts one
    final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of sight./
    From somewhere in the distance comes a heart-wrenching scream of mortal
    terror! "NO! DON'T! NO! NO! HELP!!!!" cries the voice, and then
    lets out a wail of agony that is cut off abruptly. Subdued crunching
    and slurping sounds can be heard for a minute or so, and then silence
    falls./
    All of the sudden, into the light of your lamp walks a procession of
    little men in green suits and green top hats. In front of the
    procession, six of them carry a tiny coffin. Sombre chords of a
    funeral march seem to be hovering in the air on the verge of
    audibility, but as you strain your ears, the only sound you can hear is
    the shuffling of little feet. The procession passes by you, without in
    any way acknowledging your presence, and disappears round a corner./
    A sepulchral voice suddenly reverberates through the cave:

    "Ralph Witt to the Main Office please! Ralph Witt to the Main Office!"/
    A sepulchral voice coming from nowhere in particular, mournfully
    announces

   +    "THIS IS A FIRE ALARM TEST. THIS IS A FIRE ALARM TEST.

    From somewhere nearby come the sounds of sliding, stumbling feet. As
    you turn towards them, the beam of your lamp falls upon a tall,
    shambling figure approaching you out of the darkness. Standing no more
    than five feet tall, it cannot possibly weigh more than fifty pounds
    including the shroud and bandages in which it is wrapped; a musty reek
    like the scent of old, dead earth seeps from it and fills the air. As
    you cower back in disgust and horror, the figure halts, examines you
    through eyes resembling wet pebbles, and whispers "Peace, man!" in a
    voice like wind rustling through dead trees. It then turns and
    shambles away into the darkness.]

    see [spiralling showers of pale yet fiery multicoloured sparks./
    a pattern of green patches, which slowly clarifies itself into a small
    plant growing at the bottom of a dark pit./
    billowing clouds of pale colours, which gradually resolve into a giant
    hungrily chewing his dirty fingernails./
    a storm of jet-black snowflakes, which gradually dissolves into a most
    terrifying giant spider crouching in the corner of a huge web. The
    darkness above the web is pulsing in a motion suggestive of the beat of
    a pair of enormous wings./
    a swirl of white mists. Through it, uncertain at first but gradually
    getting clearer, comes the image of a gleaming sword firmly embedded
    in a slab of rock./
    a pair of unfriendly eyes staring at you from darkness. Very slowly the
    image gets brighter, and gradually the ugly face of an ogre comes into
    full view./
    a swirling shower of gold and silver sparks. As you watch, mesmerised
    by the intricate patterns of their dance, the sparks gather into a
    circular band of light, which slowly contracts into a gleaming mithril
    ring./
    an intense red glow filled with clouds of dark smoke. Far below, an
    incandescent river of fire can be glimpsed through breaks in the billowing
    smoke./
    the head of a minotaur thoughtfully staring back at you./
    a swirl of darkness. Gradually a core of light develops in its centre,
    revealing the unearthly vision of a snake-like skeleton entwined with
    a peculiar metal contraption. Strangely, the image suggest hollow,
    chambering echoes, as if from a complex network of passages surrounding
    the place./
    a rose-coloured glow, which slowly contracts into the image of a huge
    crown floating in mid-air./
    a swirl of bright colours, which gradually sorts itself out into
    a giant, popping a large bottle of champagne./
    a rapidly spreading pool of darkness, in the midst of which,
    artfully highlighted by an invisible spotlight, floats a polished
    wood coffin./
    a dimly lit rock wall, with rusty stanchions, clearly intended 
    for chains./
    an inlaid chalice, dripping water from a crack in its cup./
    a seemingly random collection of white, grey and green splodges,
    which tumble around, changing their shapes and sizes, until
    out of the confusion there briefly emerges the image of a green
    foliage spreading upwards, along the face of a chalk cliff./
    a wobbling splodge of red colour against a dark background. 
    As the image gradually becomes sharper, you find yourself staring
    at a red fez rotating in mid-air in some dimly lit space./
    rivulets of black sand drifting in the wind towards a tall black
    shape, which rises into the dark sky on the horizon./
    a small sapling, clinging to the face of a sheer cliff./
    a shower of coloured droplets falling onto a dark surface and
    staining it with small splodges of colour. Slowly but surely, some
    semblance of order develops in front of your eyes, until a final
    burst of the coloured rain leaves you gazing at a somewhat blurred,
    yet unmistakable patterns of a Persian rug./
    a myriad of unfocused lights on a blue background.
    As the image gradually becomes sharper, you realise that the lights
    are sun reflections sparkling off the surface of a sea. Where the sea
    meets the sky, a distant island seems to float on the sea surface./
    a small white building, perching on the shoulder of a huge mountain./
    narrow stone steps curving up to a small landing with a window.
    Sunlight pours in through the window, and you can see dust
    motes dancing in the air, brightly lit against the dark stone walls./
    wrought iron gates, and beyond them a track leading away, into a
    dense forest./
    a black roiling, which you gradually realise is simply black sand
    swirling over a low basaltic outcrop./
    the inside of the well-house, with treasures and other objects
    heaped upon each other without rhyme or reason./
    some flickering lights, which by their feeble efforts appear to
    define a vast, dark space.]

    none the wiser for the experience.

    1. The UK Branch of the Adventure Tastefulness Committee (you know
    who you are gentlemen) for a pleasant evening in the Czech Club,
    where the seeds of Adv770 were planted and watered by a quantity of
    Czech Budvar (i.e. the real thing, as opposed to that other alleged
    beer that goes by a similar name).

    2. His family, who put up with him during the lengthy gestation and
    development of the game.

    3. And, of course, the star testers!... Alpha phase: Homfray-Cooper.
    Beta phase: Russ Karlberg, Ambrosine and Dave Payne. Gamma phase:
    Dave Picton, Arnold C. Vermeulen and (better late than never!) Roger
    the Dodger. Without their dedication and patience the game would have
    remained bugged and full of holes.

    4. Last but not least, all the fans of Adv660 (a.k.a. Adventure4+) who
    kept wistfully asking about a sequel. Without them Adv770 would not have
    been born and all the loose ends of Adv660 would have remained loose!

#
TEXT VOCAB.GENERAL
    Generally I understand commands in the form of "verb" or "verb noun", 
    such as for instance ENTER or LIGHT LAMP. If you use more words than two,
    I'll assume that you forgot to use punctuation and will do my
    best to work out how to split the command into two or more. There are
    some exceptions to this: if getting or dropping ALL or TREASURE, you
    can use EXCEPT (or BUT) like this: DROP ALL EXCEPT LAMP, BOTTLE AND KEYS.
   
    In practice this means that if you think that you need a command
    consisting of a verb and two nouns, for example PUT BIRD IN CAGE,
    you are definitely on the wrong track. Instead, you should trust me
    to do the right thing when you get it right. So if you are in a
    position to pick up the bird, I'll put it into the cage (if you
    have it and if the bird is amenable!) without being told to do so.

    The vocabulary display is split into several sections, of which this
    is the first. Others list specific categories of words, which I 
    understand. You can tell me to show you just one of these lists,
    rather than the whole lot, by specifying which list you want to
    see - e.g. VOCAB VERBS will only show you the bit relating to verbs,
    which is the one you should study most frequently and diligently.
#
TEXT VOCAB.VERBS
    The below verb list is not complete, but with the exception of magic
    formulae, it includes (but is not restricted to) all verbs you need 
    for the ultimate success. I've thrown in some words which are not
    strictly verbs, but you can use as such (e.g. EAST or TERSE). Some
    useful synonyms and abbreviations are given in brackets.

    east (e), north (n), northeast (ne), northwest (nw), south (s),
    southeast (se), southwest (sw), west (w), up (u), down (d)

    again (repeat, r), back (b, retreat), blast, break, brief, change, chew
    (bite), climb, close (lock), contemplate (meditate), credits (ack), cross,
    cut, dig, drink, drop (dr, free, release), dwarvish, eat, english, enter
    (in), exit (out), extinguish (off), feed, fill, fly, go (walk, run,
    follow), get (g, take, t), give (offer), help (?), history, hit, hoot,
    info, instructions (intro), inventory (i), jump, kick, kill, knock, lift,
    light (on), listen, look (l, examine, x), memorize (remember), open
    (unlock), play, pour, quit (q, cancel, abort), read, recall, redo,

    save, say, score (sc), scream, scry, sip (taste), tame (placate), terse,
    throw (th), translate, undo, unroll, upstream, verbose, vocabulary, wash,
    wave (swing), wear.
#
FRAGMENT VOCAB.NOUNS
    The below list of nouns is largely confined to things 
    and beings which you have already encountered in the game, and 
    to which you can sensibly refer, and may (or may not) be able to
    manipulate. For your convenience I include the three generic nouns
    ALL, IT and TREASURE, and some ubiquitous adventuring items even 
    though you may not have seen them yet. Here's the current list:

    all (everything), it, treasure (tr, valuables),_

TEXT VOCAB.TRAVEL
    In order to travel, use directions and travel options.

    Directions: north (n), northeast (ne), east (e), southeast (se),
    south (s), southwest (sw), west (w), northwest (nw),
    up (u) and down (d)

    Generally speaking, above ground you can move in any direction
    not specifically excluded by the description (though whether you
    would always wish to do so is another matter). In the cave, the
    reverse is true - mostly the only exits available are those mentioned
    in the description of the location. Though there are exceptions.

    You can if you like keep typing commands like GO NORTH, but you can
    drop the GO - just NORTH (or simply N) will do just as well.

    Travel options are special words, like BUILDING, which allow you
    to travel some distance in one move. Naturally, they only work in
    a few restricted places. Just where, you will have to discover for
    yourself.

    Travel options: barren, bedquilt, building, depression, fork, pit, 
    secret, view, ... I am myself unsure of the complete list. 
    There may be others.
#
TEXT VOCAB.SCREEN
    There are several commands affecting screen display, though please 
    note that these have no effect at all unless the game is being played
    in a console window (a.k.a. a terminal emulator).

    screen (depth, scroll) followed by a number, specifies the number
    of text lines in your screen (or window) -- the default value is 24,
    the minimal value is 4.

    length (line, width) followed by a number, specifies the width
    of the screen (or window) in characters -- default 80, minimal value 16.

    margin (offset) followed by a number, specifies the number of blank
    characters to be left at either side of the displayed 
    text -- the default margin is 1.

    justify toggles on and off the right margin justification of the 
    displayed text -- the default is no justification.

    All of these options, and some others too, can be specified in the
    command which invokes the game, or in the A-code configuration file.
    See the README file for details.

    Despite all their craftsmanship, the fangs do not feel very
    comfortable. I suppose the vampire's jaw is rather narrower than

    The pine wood is tough and resiny, but the vampire fangs
    are equal to the task and you chew your way round the trunk
    in a neat circle, gradually cutting deeper and deeper into the
    wood. As the cut gets deeper the tree begins to shudder,
    showering you with dry pine needles. Having chewed nearly
    through, you step back and lean on the pine, gently toppling 
    it across the gap. As its branches hit the other side, the tree
    bounces a bit, but quickly settles down. You remove the fangs
    with a sigh of relief.

    proceeds to fit to his left eye socket. Once so equipped, he focuses
    his eyes somewhere in the area of your throat and drawls in
    an impeccable upper class accent: "Ah, mah young friend... How vehra
    apposite... Ah could use ah drink, to be sure..." Fortunately, 
    the combined hypnotic effect of the gaze and the voice is promptly
    spoiled by a mighty hiccough, which causes the vampire to lose his

    letting the monocle drop back into the coffin.

    It may be useful to recall the geometric laws of stability. The

    gravity to be above it as you inch your way to the sapling. Hence
    your weight inevitably pulls you away from the cliff-face.

    to counteract this pull, and you won't get very far hanging on to

TEXT SHARP.WALLS
   The walls have lots of nasty sharp edges here. Better be careful!

TEXT PLOVER.PATH
   The path is quite narrow, but it does seem to open up a bit further on.
#
TEXT increment NO.ENTER.PENTAGRAM
   [If I may draw your attention to such insignificant cabbalistic
   details, the absence of any sygils in the pentagram's points suggests
   that its magic is a confining rather than protective one. Or to put
   it more plainly, it is expected to have the spirits confined *inside*,
   while the magus remains *outside*, not the other way around./As I
   think I already explained, that would be foolhardy. Given the nature
   of the pentagram, you could easily find yourself trapped in there./You
   seem to have some difficulty grasping a very simple point - you don't
   want to enter the pentagram. Trust me!/Sigh... No.]
#
TEXT GLOWING.CAIRN
   The cairn is made of large rocks, which for some strange reason
   emit an eerie light.
#
TEXT NO.GET.GLOWING.ROCK
   The cairn rocks are far too large for you to shift[/, let alone
   to carry about].
#
TEXT RUMBLING.VOLCANO
   All you can hear is the [/rather ]distant rumbling of the
   volcano[//, mingled with basilisk's snores].
#
TEXT BASILISK.HOLLOW
   Basilisk dens usually do not amount to much, and indeed, this one
   is really just a little hollow in the rock. It has no significance
   other than the place where the basilisk is to be found.
#
TEXT SURVEYORS.MARK
   The Y2 chiselled into the rock looks very much like a surveyor's
   mark.
#
TEXT DUSTY.PLACE
   For some reason it is exceptionally dusty around here. But
   don't let such trivia distract you from your questing.
#
TEXT USELESS.CRACKS
   All these cracks are far too small to be of any use to you.
#
TEXT DIRT.AND.DUST
   There's plenty of dirt and dust all over this blessed place, none of

#
TEXT DIRTY.PLACE
   Agreed, this place is quite exceptionally dirty, but it isn't polite
   to remark on such things.
#
TEXT STONE.SPIRAL
   The spiral staircase is formed by slabs of stone protruding in a
   spiral fashion from a massive column, which [rises from a hole
   in the floor and /]disappears through a[nother/] hole in the ceiling.
#
TEXT USEFUL.HOLES
   The[re are holes everywhere/ walls are like Swiss cheese - full of
   holes]. Some may be even large enough for you to crawl through.
#
TEXT SMOOTH.PATCH
   Hmmm... It looks surprisingly smooth...
#
TEXT BLOCKED.FORK
   The debris blocking the fork exit is pretty effective in its task,
   but otherwise neither the debris, nor the fork are of any interest
   to you.
#
TEXT RIBBED.WALLS
   The walls have a curious "ribbed" texture, quite
   incidentally giving this place a look suggestive of an enormous
   rib cage.
#
TEXT NARROW.CHIMNEY
   The chimney is narrow, but not too narrow for you to climb [up/down] it.
#
TEXT LARGE.HOLE
   It's large. It would have to be for that waterfall to drain down it!
#
TEXT EDGE.ON.MIRROR
   It's huge, but from here you can only see it edge-on.
#
TEXT increment LAVA.TUBE
   The lava tube is a roughly cylindrical passage, with walls composed
   of hardened lava.[ Such tubes are sometimes formed when a rapid
   lava flow is suddenly interrupted and the lava drains away, leaving
   behind just the solidified tubular shell./]
#
TEXT LAVA.SLIDE
   The lava tube leads steeply down and in fact forms a kind of a slide.
   So much so that climbing up it look pretty much impossible.
#
TEXT THIS.IS.LAVA
   Lava is a the molten rock spewed out by volcanoes, which solidifies
   as it cools down. The resulting rock can vary in hardness, depending
   on the amount of gas trapped within it. This lot here, for example, is
   pretty hard.
#
TEXT SEDIMENTARY.ROCK
   As the word suggests, sedimentary rock consists of petrified
   sediments that had accumulated at the bottom of a sizable body of
   water. It is therefore not unusual to find embedded in it remnants
   of water-living creatures, shells being particularly frequent because
   of their non-organic composition. Around here, though, the abundance
   of small shells in the rock is quite astounding - it suggests
   huge colonies of mollusks, living for millenia in a sheltered
   nook.
#
TEXT ITS.SHELLS
   The shells are really rather too small to make out any details
   with a naked eye. Besides, the individual shells would be probably
   only of interest to a marine paleontologist. It is their quantity
   that catches attention.   
#
TEXT RESERVOIR.PASSAGES
   I assume you mean the passage that you can just about discern
   across the water to the [north/south]. Sorry, can't see enough of it
   from here. The other one, leading [south/north] is just your standard
   dark passage.
#
TEXT increment STREAM.HOLE
   The hole is rather large and the stream tumbling out of it carries
   quite a lot of water.[/ I wonder... Where does all that water come from?]
#
TEXT assigned RESERVOIR.INFO
   This underground lake is in fact a pretty substantial body of water.
   One can't really tell by looking, because the water surface is rather
   churned up by the stream crashing into it, but it is quite deep 
   too.[ Who knows what monsters may live down there.../]
#
TEXT assigned  DARWINS.TRACKS
   [The tracks seem to suggest that some clawed monster occasionally
   comes out of the water here. You'd better be careful!/It's only the tracks
   left by Darwin, the tortoise - nothing to worry about.]
#
TEXT increment STONE.CAUSEWAY
   The gap of the old dry streambed would be impossible to cross, but
   for the stone causeway which leads across it.[ What is a causeway? A
   causeway, n., is a raised road across low or wet place or piece of water./]

#
TEXT REDDISH.GLOW
   It's a glow. It's reddish. It comes in through the southern wall.
   That's as much as can be said on the subject.
#
TEXT TRANSLUCENT.WALL
   It's a translucent whitish mineral of some sort. Not salt, as can be
   readily ascertained by taste. Beyond that... pass. You'd need a
   mineralogist to tell you any more about it.
#
TEXT NOT.SALT
   Well, it's certainly not salt!
#
TEXT MINERALS.APLENTY
   There's lots of various minerals all over the blessed place, but
   your task is to pilfer treasures, not to conduct a mineralogical

#
TEXT DIGGING.REMNANTS
   Some of the passages look newer then others. Whoever dug them out
   didn't really bother to clean up after themselves. But it's been like
   this for some decades, so don't let it bother you.
#
TEXT MAZED.PASSAGES
   The passages are all somewhat different, but it would be too much
   effort to try describing their subtle distinctions. They are all
   different - that's all you need to know.
#
TEXT PARTIAL.BLOCKAGE
   Looks like some of that irregular ceiling collapsed there. The
   resulting heap of debris is blocking the tunnel, but naturally enough
   the ceiling is now higher over the fall, so you can climb over easily
   enough. 
#
TEXT increment PIT.NO.BOTTOM
   There's nothing to be seen in the pit.[ This is not really surprising
   for a truly bottomless pit like this one./]
#
TEXT FIRM.EDGE
   The brink of the pit is quite solid - not much erosion around here
   I guess.
#
TEXT NOT.THERE.NO.MORE

#
TEXT MISTY.PATH

#
TEXT BOULDERS.BLOCK
   The boulders are quite large and they solidly block the two passages

#
TEXT increment MAY.CLIMB.WALL
   I would say the walls here are irregular enough to offer sufficient
   climbing opportunities.[ Why not try it?/]
#
TEXT RAMP.ABOVE
   The ramp is high above you. What you can see of it, is climbing
   very steeply around the spire up in the northerly direction.
#
TEXT NO.RAMP.ABOVE
   The ramp is too far up to see from here.   
#
TEXT ITS.SCREE

   The tunnel interior is rather dark and you can't see anything much there.
#
TEXT CUPOLA.ROOF
   The roof of the temple is a shallow cupola, presumably assembled
   of marble blocks. A clever bit of structural engineering, but
   of no interest otherwise.

   Temple walls are made of somewhat weathered, pinky-veined marble.
#
TEXT NO.CLIMB.TEMPLE

#
TEXT FALLEN.CHUNKS
   There are half-submerged chunks of rock all over the place. I guess
   falling pieces of rock could be quite a health hazard around here.
#
TEXT UPPER.REACHES
   The upper reaches of the mountain are guarded by unclimbable,
   sheer drops. There's no way to climb any higher from here.

TEXT SLIGHT.TILT
   The stone platform on which you are standing, slopes very gently
   towards the east. It's really more of a gentle tilt than your

#
TEXT ROCK.PLATFORM
   The rock platform under your feet is fairly flat and tilts
   slightly towards the east. It is well weathered by wind and rain.
#
TEXT WATERFALL.OVERHANG
   The rock overhang forms a kind of irregular sloping ceiling.
#
TEXT increment GOLDEN.WALLS
   The rock of the walls is shot with golden threads, giving them
   a distinctive golden colour.[ But don't get excited, it's just

#
TEXT increment WATERFALL.INFO
   Several widely spaced waterfalls cascade from somewhere far up

#
TEXT OUTCROP.END
   The basalt outcrop emerges from the sand a short distance
   from you and leads off to [NW/SW], among some huge dunes. It has been well
   smoothed by the wind and sand, so that walking over it should be
   quite easy.
#
TEXT OUTCROP.OTHER.END
   The NW end of the outcrop is rather more eroded than its SE one.
   This is presumably due to the rounded boulders scattered around here,
   which are liable to cause any sand carried by sandstorms to swirl
   and eddy in a chaotic fashion.
#
TEXT ROUNDED.BOULDERS
   The several boulders scattered haphazardly around here, are all well
   rounded - probably smoothed by wind and sand, rather than by water.

   mountain vegetation, but a path of some sort can
   be seen some distance below, leading off to the northwest.

#
TEXT DIRTY.ICE
   The clear blue glacial ice glistens in the light of your lamp, but
   you can't see anything through it. Maybe there is nothing to be seen.
#
TEXT ICY.WALL
   The walls and the ceiling are ice. Clear, smooth, very cold ice.
#
TEXT increment FLOOR.NOT.ICE
   [It is extremely fortunate that u/U]nlike the rest of your surroundings,
   the floor is plain solid rock.[ Otherwise walking around here would be
   sheer murder./] 
#
TEXT ICY.SLIDE
   The ice slide is steep and smooth. Not a chance of climbing it.
#
TEXT CELLAR.VIEWING
   The round cellar beyond the portcullis, is made completely of brick.
   Its floor slopes towards a small circular drain in its center.
   A large stone slab is poised over the dark exit leading north.
#
TEXT RUSTY.STAIRCASE
   The spiral staircase visible through the portcullis looks very rusty.
#
TEXT PORTCULLIS.CHAMBER
   The small chamber beyond the portcullis is only just large enough
   to accommodate the bottom of a spiral staircase, which disappears
   upwards, into the darkness.
#
TEXT BRICK.CELLAR
   As I've indicated, the cellar is made entirely of brick. This includes 
   its walls, ceiling and floor.
#
TEXT CELLAR.FLOOR
   The brick floor of the cellar slopes gently towards a circular
   drain in its center.
#
TEXT CELLAR.BRICKS
   The aggressively red bricks look fairly new.
#
TEXT CELLAR.SLAB
   The slab is large and solid. It is very effectively blocking the
   cellar entrance.
#
TEXT RUSTY.RUST
   It's kind of... rusty. Rust often is, in my experience.
#
TEXT assigned RUSTY.GAME
   Trying to clean up[ a/] rusty # is a mug's game. Let's not bother.
#
TEXT POLISHED.PASSAGE
   The floor, walls and even the ceiling of the passage have the look
   of rock gradually polished by a flow of water.
#
TEXT ARCHED.DOORWAY
   The doorway is neo-romanesque in appearance: a rounded arch, with
   only a slight point to it, and far too new to be anything but "neo-".
#
TEXT increment ITS.SEWAGE
   [Hmmm... There's some stuff floating down there in that water.
   What with the smell, I guess it's probably... er... sewage./I
   think we have already established that it is sewage down there.]
#
TEXT LOOK.SEWAGE
   Not an attractive sight. Pardon me for sparing you the details.
#
TEXT YUCKY.SLIME
   The slimy walls look highly unhygienic to me.
#
TEXT BRICK.CULVERT
   The culvert seems to be made of old bricks; and they look to
   be covered in slime, just like the walls of the shaft.
#
TEXT ITS.A.CURTAIN
   It's a heavy curtain of some sort. Further details are inessential,
   so I won't bother with them.
#
TEXT CURTAINED.OPENING
   As already noted, there is some sort of a heavy curtain covering
   the # from the other side.
#
TEXT MISTY.OPENING
   You can't see much through the opening, because of the mist,
   which obscures the view.
#
TEXT TOP.LANDING.VIEW
   [You can't see the landing from here - the door's shut!/Through the
   open door, you can see a part of the landing. There's nobody there.]
#
TEXT GNAWED.BONES
   One could almost believe some... thing!... had been gnawing at those
   bones.
#
TEXT SLIPPERY.FLOOR
   The sloping floor is quite slippery because of all that water dripping
   from the ceiling.
#
TEXT WET.CEILING
   The low roof of the cave is quite wet, with water slowly dripping from
   it in many places.
#
TEXT NO.COLLECT.WATER
   The trickle of water is too tiny and the individual water drips are
   too slow, to be of any practical use to you. 
#
TEXT NARROW.EXIT
   That # looks very narrow, but you just might be able to squeeze 
   through it, provided you leave any bulky stuff behind.
#
TEXT CRYSTAL.WALLS
   The walls are composed of thousands of crystals of smoky quartz.
   They are dark, almost black in colour.
#
TEXT TEETH.LIKE.CRYSTALS
   The crystals are the size and approximate shape of large teeth.
   They glisten in the light quite menacingly.
#
TEXT UNSAFE.ROOF
   The roof of the passage looks [rather/*very*] unsafe[./ to me! Better
   get out of here quickly!]
#
TEXT ROTTED.TIMBER
   If there ever was any timber here, it has all rotten away since then.
   I suppose that could account for the smell.
#
TEXT DECAYING.TIMBER
   Despite the evidence of recent attempts to improve things with some
   fresh timber, the overall state of the timber structure is pretty
   poor.
#
TEXT SAGGING.WALLS
   There are several falls of various sizes here, caused by the failing
   support structure. One particularly large one, has revealed
   fair-sized fracture in the west wall.
#
TEXT PIT.PATH
   The path snakes its way amongst rock slabs, across the Twopit room,
   avoiding the two major pits.
#
TEXT LOTSA.HOLES
   Plenty of small holes around here, but only the large one in the
   western wall is likely to be of any use to you.
#
TEXT THIN.SLABS
   The floor is littered with thin slabs of rock.
#
TEXT DARK.IN.THERE
   It's dark in the # - you can't see anything.
#
TEXT SOLID.COUCH
   The massive couch is very solidly built. One wouldn't expect
   otherwise for a piece of furniture used by a giant.
#
TEXT COUCH.TOO.HEAVY
   The couch is far too heavy for you to shift!
#
TEXT HIDDEN.LIGHT
   The place is lit, that's for certain. But you cannot determine where
   the light is coming from.
#
TEXT DAMP.WALLS
   The walls are damp, but I can't tell whether it's just condensation
   or whether there is some water seeping from the rock.
#
TEXT ARCH.WITH.STEPS
   To the north, there is a low stone archway, with steps leading
   down into the darkness.
#
TEXT increment ELRIC.PREFERRED
   [No, no, I don't want to talk about Mr Cornelius. Yes, so, he was
   here too... So? Personally, I much prefer Lord Elric!/Mr Cornelius is not
   a topic I am prepared to discuss. Sorry...]
#
TEXT increment ELRIC.LIVES
   [Elric of Melnibone? I've never actually met him, but by all accounts
   he is a real gentleman!/One of these days he'll visit too, perhaps.
   It would really make my day!/ Ah... Lord Elric... \[sigh...\]]
#
TEXT cycle JERRY.WORDS
   "Jerry Cornelius was here." [So, big deal! So were many other
   people./Not sure why he thought we wanted to know./ As useless
   a piece of information as you are likely to encounter./I guess he
   thought we would be impressed./Not that this should concern you in
   any way/One could speculate as to why, but it would be boring./And
   who cares!]
#
TEXT MASS.OF.BOULDERS
   Any further progress along the canyon is blocked by a veritable
   mass of large boulders, piled higgledy-piggledy in a huge pile all
   the way to the ceiling.
#
TEXT TABLE.VIEW
   From what you can see of the table with all the stuff on it, it is a mess.
#
TEXT STONE.FACES
   The stone faces are amazingly life-like, especially so in the
   flickering light of the volcano.[ One in particular seems
   to be looking straight at you with a quizzical lift of an eyebrow,
   as if questioning your presence here, while at the same time
   approving of that same presence with a benevolent smile./]
#
TEXT STALACTITE.IN.MAZE
   The stalactite is unusually large, and will probably support your
   weight.
#
TEXT STALACTITE.ROOF
   There are a number of small stalactite-like protrusion hanging from 
   the ceiling, in addition to the one large one, which descends almost
   all the way to the floor below.
#
TEXT ORANGE.COLUMN
   It's really a huge stalactite fused with the wall and coloured
   orange by some minerals dissolved in the water that had made it.
#
TEXT ORANGE.BRINK
   A sharp edge, beyond which there is a sheer drop of about thirty feet.
#
TEXT WARM.WALLS
   The walls of this chamber are just normal cave walls, the only
   unusual thing about them being their remarkable warmth.
#
TEXT CHAMBER.BOULDERS
   The large, rough-edged boulders nearly fill this small chamber.
#
TEXT increment UP.WELL.VIEW
   You look up towards the circular patch of daylight above your head,
   but see nothing worth noting.[ If you were expecting to see stars,
   I have to disappoint you. My many visits to this well lead me to
   conclude that being able to see stars at daytime from the bottom of a
   well, is just one of those popular myths, with no actual substance
   to it./]
#
TEXT WELL.WALL
   The walls of the old well may be damp and crumbly, but they still
   offer sufficient foot and hand-holds, should you be inclined to try
   climbing them.
#
TEXT DAYLIGHT.ABOVE
   It comes from somewhere above, but you can't actually see its source.
#
TEXT LOBBY.WORDS
   The words still say "ENCHANTED CATACOMBS".
#
TEXT LOBBY.ARCHWAY
   It looks most imposing - an impression further enhanced by those
   portentous words above it.
#
TEXT DARK.PORTAL
   It is dark beyond the portal, so you can't see anything there,
   but the echoes suggest a large space beyond.
#
TEXT PORTAL.ECHOES
   It is deathly quiet. As you pause to listen, even the echoes of
   your movements cease.
#
TEXT PLENTY.ABOUT
   There's plenty of # about.
#
TEXT JONAH.TEETH
   It's a bizarre sight - the image of gigantic clenched teeth is
   quite inescapable!
#
TEXT JONAH.BLACKNESS
   Even by the exacting standards of this cave, it is a very black
   blackness!
#
TEXT ROMANTIC.VIEW
   It's a highly romantic sight, though I suspect, somewhat "enhanced" in 
   some magical way. [I don't recall nearby mountains or lakes around here,
   and the meadows are far too lush for the local sunny climate./A
   ravine, yes, but we don't have enough surface water for a decent
   torrent here, with or without rapids!/The cliff's plausible enough,
   but that raging sea doesn't quite square with what one can see of the
   sea from elsewhere.] In any case, it's just scenery.
#
TEXT SHARP.THORNS
   The thorns on the rose bushes are wickedly sharp.
#
TEXT WILD.ROSE.BUSHES
   The rose bushes are badly neglected and by now mostly wild.
   Vigorous shoots grown from the root stock have largely overwhelmed
   the grafted, garden variety. The result is a prickly tangled mess
   with only a few small, wild rose flowers.
#
TEXT DEAD.ROSE.BUSHES
   The rose bushes enclosing this area are mostly dead.
#
TEXT ROSE.FLOWERS
   The rose bushes have gone wild, with the result of there being
   only a few small, simple rose flowers.
#
TEXT increment NO.PICK.ROSES
   Better not - you might prick yourself, with who knows what
   consequences. [Blood poisoning, for example. Or worse... 
   Besides,/And] you don't need rose flowers[/ anyway].
#
TEXT NO.CUT.ROSES
   Look, this is an archetypal wild rose garden. You wouldn't want to 
   spoil it by clearing out the tangle, would you? You would? Well *I*
   wouldn't.
#
TEXT GRAVEL.PATH
   Patches of grass and weeds grow through the gravel of the path[/s].
#
TEXT ORDINARY.GRASS
   It's just ordinary grass and weeds, growing here just because
   such things do grow if not kept in check. So just don't bother.
#
TEXT TOWER.NO.CLIMB
   The sheer wall of the tower does not offer enough purchase for
   climbing.
#
TEXT BELOW.TOWER
   The [tower wall, overgrown with ivy/sheer wall of the tower] looms
   above you.
#
TEXT TOWER.OVER.ROSES
   A short way off, the top part of the white tower can be seen above
   the rose bushes.
#
TEXT TOWER.TO.SOUTH
   The south running path leads directly to the foot of the imposing
   white tower.
#
TEXT CAST.SHADOW
   It's just the shadow cast by the #. Not anything of particular interest.
#
TEXT IGNORE.SHADOWS
   There's many a shadow around here, naturally enough. Let's not get
   distracted by the fact.
#
TEXT OLD.PERGOLA
   There's not much to be seen of the old pergola. Some of it has fallen
   down, and the rest is thoroughly overgrown by wild roses.
#
TEXT SPIRE.NO.SUN
   You can't see the sun from here - it's behind the spire.
#
TEXT THIS.IS.BALCONY
   As a guess, it started off as a piece of rock jutting out of the
   cavern wall, but it has been extensively carved, presumably by
   dwarves, who are great stone carvers and masons, into its current
   shape of a proper balcony with a stone balustrade.
#
TEXT THIS.IS.BALUSTRADE
   The balustrade is fashioned out of the "living rock", to look like
   a row of closely spaced small columns, with a continuous piece of
   stone laid over them.
#
TEXT BALCONY.TORCHES
   A large number of flickering torches can be seen set into the chamber 
   walls, quite high above the ground.
#
TEXT DUNGEON.PASSAGE
   It leads to the giant's quarters.
#
TEXT AUDIENCE.LIGHT
   I really cannot describe it any better than as "moonlight shining off
   polished silver". As to what is doing the shining, I really can't tell.
#
TEXT RED.PILLARS
   The pillars are fashioned of red Egyptian granite - very rare! In
   fact, their whole look is vaguely Egyptian, though it may be just 
   their massive presence that reminds one of the monumental Egyptian 
   architecture.
#
TEXT JUST.THAT
   It's just ordinary #. Nothing fancy.
#
TEXT increment AUDIENCE.WALLS
   Just take my word for it - the walls are the finest marble you could
   possibly imagine[, and I don't care how good your imagination is/].
#
TEXT AUDIENCE.FLOOR
   The slabs of onyx and bloodstone, which make up the floor of this
   chamber, are heavy and well fixed in place. There's no moving any of them.
#
TEXT NO.GO.DAIS
   Most of the dais is occupied by that throne-like thing. There's not
   enough room for you on it as well.
#
TEXT AUDIENCE.DAIS
   The dais is large but not very high. It is more of a raised part of
   the floor than a "thing" in its own right.
#
TEXT SKELETON.HAND
   The bony hand clutching the sceptre doesn't look anatomically
   right to me, but I confess I know very little about such things.
#
TEXT AUDIENCE.THRONE
   The interlocking metal bars and rods of of the throne are all well
   polished.
#
TEXT WATER.DROPS
   The place is dank and damp, but there's no actual water here, except
   for an occasional drip from the ceiling. You'd die of thirst trying
   to collect water here!
#
TEXT ROCK.WALL
   It's a rock wall - solid and unclimbable. I'd venture a guess that
   it was put there as an obstacle.
#
TEXT STONE.FEET
   The statue's massive feet are high above you, so you can't see them
   very well.
#
TEXT increment BLASTED.RUBBLE
   The whole floor is covered with rubble from the collapsed wall.[ You
   haven't the time to search the rubble for any loot. And as
   for survivors, rest assured that there aren't any. Tragic!
   Positively tragic! But it was an accident, of course.../]
#
TEXT BLASTED.WALL
   The blast caused the NE wall to shed a massive amount of rock, 
   which is now covering the floor in a deep layer of heaped rubble.
   In the middle of the newly exposed surface is a large dark opening.
#
TEXT ARABESQUE.PATTERNS
   The patterns look very ornamental, but quite pointless.
#
TEXT REFLECTIVE.MINERALS
   Some mineral crystals embedded in the shaft walls, reflect and
   refract the light of your lamp. It's rather pretty, really.
#
TEXT GOLD.SEAMS
   The walls show great seams of gold-bearing rock. Unfortunately the
   they are out of your reach, and in any case, you don't have access to
   any of the equipment that would be required for extracting gold
   from that rock. Then again, maybe there's nothing unfortunate about
   it. Just digging gold, would make for a very dull game.
#
TEXT FOREST.VIEW
   The tower is surrounded by a dense mass of conifers, but conifers are
   replaced by tall pines on the hill to the north. To the east,
   conifers gradually give way to oaks and maples. 
#
TEXT CRAGGY.ROCKS
   A crag is just a fancy name for a large, craggy piece of rock
   sticking above other scenery - and that's exactly what you see there.
#
TEXT BIT.OF.A.HILL
   It's not a very big hill, with some pines growing on it and a track
   running up towards its top from the forest below.
#
TEXT TRACK.FROM.TOWER
   The track starts from the garden gates and runs north through the
   conifers, bending to the right. It is soon hidden by the trees,
   but it seems to be the same track as can be seen further off,
   climbing up, to the top of the hill.   
#
TEXT SUSPENDED.SLAB
   It would appear that the slab is designed to close the opening in the
   south wall, but it is not at all clear what would trigger this
   action.
#
TEXT NO.MOVE.SLAB
   The slab refuses to be moved, however hard you try to # it.
#
TEXT NO.BREAK.MECHANISM
   That would be exceedingly unwise. Please pay attention to that warning,
   which strongly suggests caution. Only a fool would try meddling with
   wizardly contraptions.
#
TEXT DELICATE.MECHANISM
   The counterweight mechanism looks rather strange, which is only to be
   expected when wizardly designs are involved. Its main purpose
   appears to be to hold that slab suspended in the air, though I would
   not swear to this being its only purpose.
#
TEXT SNAKE.PIT
   The snake pit is not very deep, but fortunately for you, it's
   deep enough to keep the snakes confined in it.
#
TEXT NO.GO.SNAKE.PIT
   No, no... You *really* don't want to climb into that snake pit!
#
TEXT LIQUID.LIGHT
   'Tis a wondrous sight! The stalactite is covered by veins of pulsing
   blue light, which accumulates on the stalactite's tip as 
   a bright, iridescent globule. This globule gradually elongates until
   a large drop breaks off and floats towards the ground, vanishing
   suddenly in a puff of blue mist about half way down.
#
TEXT UNCAST.SHADOWS
   The shadows flit too fast for you to make anything of them.
#
TEXT SORCEROUS.RUNES
   The runes and scripts are quite incomprehensible, as you might have
   gathered from my reference to "indecipherable scripts". Be content
   with being able to read that "noside samoht" phrase!
#
TEXT SNORING.DWARVES
   Dwarf snoring is not a beautiful sound. Let's not dwell on it.
#
TEXT NO.APPARITIONS
   Well, when I say "apparitions" I don't *really* mean "apparitions" - it's
   just a figure of speech, to describe the sinister, but quite natural
   shadow-play on the walls.
#
TEXT ALABASTER.FORMATIONS
   The twisted alabaster formations do some really strange things with 
   the flickering glare of the volcano. The resulting shadow-play upon
   the walls is quite sinister.
