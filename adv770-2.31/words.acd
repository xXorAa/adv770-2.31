noise the, that, this, !awhile
#
# Time we defined some verbs. 
#
# N.B. - the following magic words (ZORTON through BASINGSTOKE) #must#
# be defined in reverse alphabetical order!  If new magic words
# are added, place them in the proper sequence and modify the
# code in the "AT NOWHERE" area!  If you don't do this right, 
# people are going to have a hell of a time getting out of Nowhere
# during cave-closure. One extra complication... adding magic words
# can make the safe unresponsive to any of the 4 keys in saved games.
# Finally, note that the '!' prefixing magic words makes them
# non-abbreviable - the same would work for any other dictionary 
# word too.
