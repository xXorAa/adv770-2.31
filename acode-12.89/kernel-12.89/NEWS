-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.89

1. Fixed orphan command word handling in single turn build modes - cloud,
   library and HTML/JavaScript.

2. Renamed two adv00.c functions: 
   input() to get_command() - because it may not actually result in a prompt
   to the player
   getinput to get_input() - in keeping with get_command from which it
   gets called if current command line has been exhausted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.88

1. Fixed spurious double blank lines following centered game messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.87

1. DUMPDATA (formerly DUMP) no longer depends on presence of cross-
   reference files. It now shows symbolic names if either the special
   variable ENTNAME is defined, or acdc is given the -debug command line
   option. It also provides a wealth of other information, representing
   the complete current state of the game.

2. If log is explicitly specified rather than just requested by naked
   -l, and the specification is not an absolute pathname, it is 
   interpereted as relative to the current working directory. If it amounts
   to a directory, then the default log name is appended (name of the
   game, suffixed with .log). If only -l is given, then the default name
   log is created alongside game save files.

3. The -d acdc option now causes the game to report at run-time A-code
   lines being executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.86

1. Fixed occasional game crashes in the Windows console mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.85

1. HTML centering of tables and divs changed to the HTML5 standard.

2. Fixed centering of individual lines and of blocks of lines in non-HTML
   displays

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.84

1. Fixed the CGI mode to signal game being resumed on auto-load.

2. The help text now lists available baud rate values.

3. Added handling of IFTURN, checking for a single-turn mode (CGI or
   or library build mode).

4. Expanded use of PROMPTED to library build replacing the old rep/nrep
   mechanism.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.83

1. Fixed handling of centred lines, which used to swallow the first character
   of the line being centred.

2. UTF8 support is now unconditional.

3. Complete internatinalisation of player commands now feasible.

4. Fixed kernel handling of player's SAY command.

5. Fixed random crashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.82

1. Fixed NEEDCMD handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
New in 12.81

1. Fixed game invocation when it is invoked by simple name, rather than
   pathname. 

2. Modified daeminizations of invoked browser to account for new Firefox
   behaviour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.80

1. Fixed the DESCRIBE directive processing so that it works for 
   places as well as for objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.79

1. Increased maximal command length to 4K bytes. Yeah, it's a fudge.
   Should make input buffers fully dynamic. One day, maybe...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.78

1. Added support for UTF8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.77

1. Solved CGI mode not exiting after prompt if no-CGI args. (Cosmetic.)

2. TEXT/HTML component in ADVLIB mode args now honoured by all initial
   commands, except for the LIST one.

3. In QT builds, LIST mode now looks in game's ~/.acode subdirectory, rather
   than in the currect directory. 

4. Fixed a bug in the Javascript build, which stopped a list of saved games
   being offered to the player to choose from.

5. Fixed player command parsing to make "and" (a.k.a. ",") work whether
   or not the PLS.CLARIFY flag is declared.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.76

1. Stopped binary junk being occasionally appended to .adl save files.

2. NBSP now always converted to either &nbsp; or a blank, as appropriate.

3. Tightened undo history restore game structure check.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.75

1. In order to support library mode use by QT5, stripped all line feeds
   from HTML formatted output.

2. Fixed output filter to replace " with &quot; in html-formatted centred
   text (individual lines as well as blocks).

3. Fixed the browser mode problem, which occasionally caused the browser
   to come up showing lowercase 'k' and otherwise blank window.

4. Fixed odd undo/redo counts in the CGI mode.

5. Stripped off line feeds from HTML output (QT WebView doesn't like them!)

6. Stopped nonsense output for locations with no description of any kind.

7. Removed -u command line option as unnecessary.

8. Scene word matching no longer accepts abbreviations.
 
9. If SEEN flag is not declared, abbreviation and approximate matching are
   restricted by object proximity (i.e. neither INHAND, nor HERE).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.74

1. Removed the no longer used shutterm() routine. Affects only OSX build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.73

1. In the ADVLIB mode, a null command results just in a prompt, instead of
   echoing the output of the previous non-null command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.72

1. JS mode now displays a "Play again" button when the game is
   terminated. (NB: this is not possible in the browser mode!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.71

1. In ADVLIB mode, REPEAT_PROC will now skip repeat blocks preceding
   the one that requested player input. This means such blocks no longer
   get executed twice!

2. Main data arrays (IMAGE and image) are now forced to align on int
   memory boundary -- this cures a nasty UNDO problems in JS and CGI modes.

3. In the CGI mode, -h no longer shows options not applicable in that mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.70

1. Eliminated all setjmp/longjmp calls!

2. Replaced mode specification via the cgi variable with a more
   transparent combination of the mode variable and distinct build
   modes (the default CONSOLE/HTTP, CONSOLE, ADVLIB and CGI).

3. In the CGI mode, the -x and -y keywords are now deprecated. 
   Use -n instead of -x. Use -- instead of -y. For either -- or -y
   the rest of the command line is interpreted as a command 
   (e.g. -- GET LAMP). 

4. Fixed handling of 'noise' command words.

5. Modified the VOCAB directive to honour replacement test (arg 4)
   in vocabulary initialisation aclls (arg 1 being 0).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.69

1. Added support for the optional special variable ENTNAME to display
   name of entity pointed to by this when used in the nested text
   syntax {ENTNAME}.

2. If ENTNAME defined, and if no exact match is found for a word in
   player's command, then before proceeding with approximate matching,
   check that word against the stored complete list of entity names
   (translating full stops into underscores, to avoid the parser 
   splitting entity names containing full stops).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.68

1. Fixed suppression of abbreviations on initial query for game to restore.

2. In pure JavaScript, ifhtml is now always true.

3. Fixed end pause handling in the library mode.

4. Fixed initial restore in the library mode.

5. Improved OSX builds to a avoid proliferation of terminal windows.

6. Fixed MSDOS builds.

7. Full game initialisation is now performed on startup in all
   circumstances, including the case of game in progress being restored.

8. Added EXEC 17 and EXEC 18 to special(). The former stores in memory
   current locations of all objects (intended to be called in an INIT
   section); the latter returns the stored location of a given object.
   The purpose is to simplify Adv440 (and perhaps 660 and 770)
   implementation of dwarves, to reflect the Fortran original.

9. NB: Safari 9 and MS Edge are now also known to work with the pure
   Javascript builds of A-code games.  

10. Non-ANSI C support removed.

11. In the console mode, suppress leading blanks when splitting lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.64

1. Fixed calculation of block-centre offset.

2. Added pure JavaScript support (via Emscripten to generate JS code).
   This uses IndexedDB browser storage and this is currently known to
   be compatible with Firefox (version 4 and higher), Chrome (version 11
   and higher and IE (version 10 and higher).

3. Added JS compilation symbol alongside IOS. Both imply ADVLIB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in 12.63 version (since 12.54)

1. Fixed prompt_line being undefined if NO_READLINE is specified.

2. BROWSER mode no longer ignores BROWSER NONE in the config file.

3. The -C command like keyword can be used with the CGI mode with
   the result of output being plain text rather than HTML.

4. Added ADVLIB mode for platforms such as iOS, which insist on being
   in control of the main loop.

5. Added emscripten support for producing a pure Javascript version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.54

1. Bug fix. Command line parsing no longer aborts after some of
   the keywords.

2. Bug fix. UNDO or REDO can no longer leave the game expecting 
   a yes/no answer to a question asked just before the point
   to which the game has reverted.
     
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.53

1. Bug fix. Game no longer crashes in the console mode in response to
   player hitting Ctrl-D when prompted for input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.52

1. Bug fix for MS Windows and DOS. The RESTORE command no longer causes 
   infinite loop if there are no saved games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.51 (12.40 to 12.50 never released)

1. Glk support dropped. On all platforms the game executable
   uses browser display or runs in the console window.

2. Added TIMEOUT section to the config file.

3. Added COLOUR SURROUND to the config file.

4. When creating a config file, BROWSER section is now platform
   sensitive, differentiating Windows and non-Windows installs.

5. Readline is now linked by default, suppressed by -DNO_READLINE.

6. Acode directory is now by default .acode on non-Windows platforms.
   If this is not found, the acode one is used instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.39 (12.35 to 12.38 never released)

1. Re-wrote code for locating acode.inf.

2. Added macro platform definitions (LINUX, UNIX, MACOS, WINDOWS)
   replacing the PLATFORM macro.

3. Fixed some text formatting bugs.

4. Fixed STYLE 1 orphan handling.

5. Fixed STYLE 1 segfault in response to an unknown command word.

6. Finished version 12 CGI mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.34

1. Fixed logging mechanism so that the prompt line is written into the
   log too.

2. Finally got around to sorting out A-code 12 CGI mode.

3. In HTML modes (CGI or browser) prompt type is signalled by the first
   letter of the complete message, not by the last one.

4. Fixed handling of texts declared as fragments part-way through
   the text rather than in the text declaration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.33

1. The DEFAULT directive now differentiates between failure to
   find any target and a failure to find a unique tagret. These outcomes
   are signalled by AGR2 being set to 0 or AMBIGWORD respectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.32.

1. Fixed the the debug mode DUMP command (implemented in show_data()).

2. Fixed display width definition in browser mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.31.

1. Fixed output formatting bug, which in some circumstances suppressed
   the command prompt.

2. Added "SHOW WIDTH <number>" directive to acode.conf. This specifies
   in pixels the width of the actual display area. Default value 700. 

3. Added "SURROUND <colour>" directive to acode.conf to specify the
   colour of the window outside the display area. Defaults to dark grey.

NB: the new directives will not show automatically in your acode.conf.
You can add them manually, or remove (or rename) the existing
acode.conf, which will result in a new one being created by the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.30.

1. Worked around the problem caused by a change in xdg-open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in A-code 12.29.

1. Some changes to acdc (version 12.18) -- see the acdc README and NEWS
   files.

2. All A-code game executables now accept the -v keyword, which causes
   the display of the game version number, the version number of the
   acdc translator used to create the C sources, and the A-code kernel
   version.

3. Game's home is now acode/<gamename> which is, if required,
   automatically created in the player's home directory. This is where
   games will be saved and old saved games will be looked for. It is
   also where log files (if any) are created by default.

4. As a temporary measure in this version, on game startup other likely
   places are checked for containing older saved games, and any saved
   games fuond are copied into the game's home directory.

5. Games now have a persistent state, so that if a game is interrupted
   in some manner, rather than cleanly exited, it will automatically
   restart the next time at the same point. Use the -n invocation command
   line option to avoid restarting an interrupted game.

6. On Linux/Unix/MacOS, the default game mode is to use a local browser
   for its display. Use the -C command invocation line option to use
   old-fashioned, console display with readline command recall and editing.
   On windows only the "dumb" DOS prompt mode is available, unless the
   game is built to use the Glk library.
