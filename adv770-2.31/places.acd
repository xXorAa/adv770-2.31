   You're on the top of the hill.
  %You have walked up a hill, still in the forest, which rapidly
   becomes denser and darker in the westerly directions. To the north
   lies a snow-capped mountain range with peaks that rise into the sky.
   To the southwest, partly obscured by a thin haze, a square white
   flat-topped tower rises  above the trees. To the east the road 
   runs down the hill towards a small building visible in the distance. 
   A wide forest track leads down the hill and into the thicket to
   the west.
#

#  one another, else the player will never get the full credit for the
#  starstone.
#
PLACE STUPENDOUS.VIEW
   You're at the magnificent view.
  %You are on a broad patch of sunlit grass, enclosed by steep
   chalk banks lined with flowering gorse bushes and topped with a
   crowded phalanx of firs. A narrow ravine leads southeast. [To
   the west the banks and the grass suddenly give way to a sheer
   cliff drop of about a thousand feet. The view is quite
   magnificent: far beneath you the sea sparkles in the sun, white
   headed rollers break on a golden beach and an island is
   floating in haze on the horizon, seemingly suspended between
   the sea and the sky. In the middle of the grass is a
   flattened, trampled looking area with the old remains of a fire
   in the centre. A semicircular indentation in the ashes could
   be easily taken for a heelprint, if it were not so large./

   cloud of white mist fills the room, rising from the surface of the

   roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling. Another
   passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
#
PLACE +BREATHTAKER
   You're at breath-taking view.
  %You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
   active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out,
   cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the
   farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving 
   everything an eerie, macabre appearance. The air is filled with
   flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone. The walls are 
   hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
   sounds. Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad
   twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter
   the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls. To
   one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
   rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself. An
   immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano,
   burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless
   pit far off to your left. Across the gorge, the entrance to a
   valley is dimly visible. To the right, an enormous geyser of
   blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the
   center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously. The far right
   wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an
   additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark,
   foreboding passage exits to the south.

PLACE +FACES
   You're at the south end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.
  %You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by
   flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you. Carved into
   the walls of the valley is an incredible series of stone faces. Some
   of them look down into the valley with expressions of benevolence that
   would credit a saint; others glare with a malice that makes the heart
   grow faint. All of them are imbued with a fantastic seeming of life by
   the shifting and flickering light of the volcano. The entire far end
   of the valley is taken up by an immense carving of a seated figure;
   its exact form cannot be seen from here due to the uncertainty of the
   light.
#
PLACE BY.FIGURE
   You're at north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.
  %You are standing at the north end of the Valley of the Stone
   Faces. Above you, an incredible bas-relief statue of an immense
   minotaur has been carved out of the rock. At least sixty feet
   high, it sits gazing down at you with a faint but definite
   expression of amusement. Between its feet and the floor is a
   rock wall about ten feet high which extends across the entire
   north end of the valley. [/Dark tunnels lead northeast, north,
   and northwest.]
#
PLACE PLAIN.1
   You're at south end of fog-filled room.
  %You are standing at the southern end of what appears to be a large room
   filled with multicolored fog. The sides and far end of the room cannot
   be seen due to the thickness of the fog - it's a real pea-souper (even
   to the color in places!). A passage leads back to the south; a dull
   rumbling sound issues from the passage.

#
PLACE STARSTONE.START    # No place at all! But places it on basalt shelf.
#
PLACE BASALT.SHELF
   You're on the narrow basalt shelf.
  %You are standing on a narrow shelf of basalt rock overlooking a lava
   beach. Behind you is an incredible black cliff, extending north, 
   south and up, seemingly forever. To the north the shelf quickly
   narrows and soon disappears altogether. To the south, after a 
   jagged break - too wide to cross or jump - it gradually widens and slopes
   down towards the beach. [The scene is illuminated by the light of
   three small moons shining through the shimmering glow of an aurora
   that fills the entire sky with its golden splendour. A light breeze
   laden with a strange and heady tang, brings the sound of
   unhurried ocean waves breaking on the beach. A dark opening leads
   east, into the cliff/
   To the east is the dark mouth of the lava tube. 
   The dark green sky is filled with a
   delicate tracery of feathery silver clouds tinged with green. 
   The silver ocean, stretching all the way to the west horizon, is
   mirror-smooth, broken only by a tall black spire rising out of the
   water far away to the west. There is a sharp chill in the still
   air and your breath condenses into clouds of mist, which slowly drift
   up along the face of the cliff./
   Two suns, one deep
   orange and the other white-blue, pour their combined light from the
   indigo sky. The silver ocean, stretching to the west as far as the
   eye can see, sparkles with green reflections as it ponderously 
   crashes its waves on the beach. Far away, near the western horizon,
   a black spire can be seen rising out of the ocean. The air is very
   still and you can see the sheet of hot air shimmering along the
   surface of the cliff. The dark mouth of a lava tube leads east/
   A huge orange sun is setting beyond the
   ocean, flooding the eerie landscape with a blood-red glow. A chill
   wind is whistling past, tugging at your clothes and swirling in the
   dark opening of the lava tube leading east. White topped rollers
   break on the beach with a hypnotic rhythm of a whoOOSH and a murmur. 
   The whole stretch of the ocean is alive with orange reflections. 
   A small moon hangs almost directly overhead, where the indigo sky
   darkens into near blackness].

PLACE +TUBE
   You're in lava tube at top of chimney.
  %You're at the top of a narrow chimney in the rock. A cylindrical tube

   You're in the Sorcerer's Lair.
  %This is the Sorcerer's Lair. The walls are covered with exotic runes
   written in strange, indecipherable scripts; the only readable phrase
   reads "noside samoht". Strange shadows flit about on the walls, but
   there is nothing visible to cast them. Iridescent blue light drips
   from a stalactite far above, falls towards the floor, and evaporates
   before touching the ground. A deep, resonant chanting sound vibrates

   You're half way up the giant beanstalk.
  %You [are/have climbed] part way [up/up/down] the beanstalk. To one side you can
   see a wide expanse of sunlit sea stretching away to the
   horizon. On the other side is a vertical cliff. A small sapling
   grows from a crack in the rock a short way north, with the
   narrowest imaginable ledge leading towards it.
#
PLACE +LEDGE
   You are miraculously clinging to the vertical cliff stretching
   far above and below you. Your only support is
   a ridiculously narrow rocky ledge which leads back south, into the
   beanstalk foliage.
#
PLACE BEANSTALK.TOP
   You're at the top of the giant beanstalk.
  %You are clinging to the stem of the beanstalk,
   surrounded by its foliage. The stem is quite narrow and it would
   be too dangerous to climb it any higher. Through gaps in the leaves
   you can see on one side a wide stretch of blue sea far below, while
   on the other side, level with you, is a trampled grassy area
   surrounded by steep chalk banks.[/ {GIANTS.PICNIC}]
#
PLACE +REPOSITORY, NE.REPOSITORY
   You're at the northeast end of the repository.
  %You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
   giant room. It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
   program. Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
   yellow light. Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
   of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a
   bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends
   and a collection of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great many
   dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly. A sign nearby
   reads "Do not disturb the dwarves!". Various other sundry objects
   can be dimly glimpsed to southwest.
#
PLACE SW.REPOSITORY
   You're at the southwest end of the repository.
  %You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is a pit
   full of fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of small wicker
   cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird. In one corner
   is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. A large
   number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor. A vast
   mirror stretches from the floor to the ceiling by the southeast wall.
#
PLACE BLASTED.REPOSITORY
   You're at the northeast end of the repository.
  %You are at the northeast end of the repository. The floor is quite
   covered with heaps of rubble which make walking extremely

   active volcano, spewing out a river of hot lava. Any wrong move,
   and you are toast.
#
PLACE QUARTERS
   You're in the living quarters.
  %You are in a chamber which is obviously some sort of living
   quarters. The room is lit, although you cannot determine
   how. To the east is the exit back to the pantry. Two other
   openings lead north and south.
   At the far end is a very large solidly built couch.
#
FRAGMENT WATER.PLOPS
   The only sound, apart from your own breathing, is the
   occasional plop of water as it drips from the ceiling.
#
PLACE +DUNGEON
   You're in the dungeon.
  %You are in a dungeon. The walls and ceiling appear to be made of solid
   rock and the floor is made up of tightly fitting flagstones. High on
   the walls are some stanchions for chains, but the chains are no longer
   in place. {WATER.PLOPS} The atmosphere
   is dank and clammy and there is an unusual smell in the air. A passage
   leads south to a lit room[/, and there is a narrow dark hole
   in the far corner, where one of the flagstones has been shifted 
   aside/].

PLACE BASEMENT
   You're in the basement.
  %You are in a room which appears to be a basement for a very large
   building. Stone steps lead upward. Above an opening to the south
   hangs a slab of rock precisely balanced by counterweights suspended
   from the ceiling. By the opening there is a notice carved in the rock,
   saying

  +        "WIZARDS ONLY, KEEP OUT".

#
PLACE CURTAIN.ENTRANCE
   You're at the curtain entrance.
  %You are at an entrance to a large room which you cannot see into
   because of a curtain blocking your view. There are flights of steps
   here leading both upward and downward.
#
PLACE +CELLAR
   You're in the cellar.
  %You are in a round cellar made completely of brick. In the center of
   the floor is a small circular drain, towards which the floor
   slopes. Set in the south wall is a portcullis which is so rusty it
   clearly will never move again. Through the portcullis a small
   chamber with a spiral staircase can be seen. An entrance leads
   north but it is blocked by a large stone slab.
#
PLACE CELLAR.VIEW
   You're at the cellar view.
  %You are at the bottom of the spiral staircase in a small room carved
   out of the rock. A strong wind blows down the shaft and through a
   large portcullis forming one wall of the room. The portcullis is
   rusted solidly in position and clearly no longer moves. A round cellar
   with a circular drain can be seen through it.
#
PLACE HALF.STAIRS
   You're at the halfway stage on the spiral staircase.
  %You are at the halfway stage on the spiral staircase. The beam from
   your lamp is reflected in the minerals contained in the walls, and you
   can see great seams of gold-bearing rock. A strong draft from the top
   of the staircase moans and whistles through the rusted tracery of the
   staircase.
#
PLACE CAUSEWAY.WEST
   You're west of the causeway.
  %To the east of you, just discernible in the gloom, lies an old stream-bed
   which has been long dry and you can just determine that there is a
   stone causeway leading across. The ground is nearly covered by wisps of
   white mist, which slowly drift eastwards and dissipate over the gap.

FRAGMENT LIGHT.TRAP     # Tied to TRAPDOOR
   [/A small amount of daylight
   falls from above through the open trapdoor. ]There are dusty,
   empty racks of shelves along the two long walls, 
   stretching [up into gloomy darkness/from the floor to the
   ceiling]. 
#
PLACE +STOREROOM
   You're in the dwarves' stores. {DOOR2.IS}
  %You are in a narrow storage room. {LIGHT.TRAP} The shelves leave
   only a narrow passage between a massive door to the west and a 
   rusty ladder affixed to the narrow eastern wall. {DOOR2.IS}
#
PLACE SHELVES.EAST
   You're at the top of the shelves, under the {ROOF.TRAP} trapdoor.
  %You are at the top of the shelves at their eastern end.
   Just above you is the wooden ceiling with a 
   rusty trapdoor set into it. The equally rusty ladder leads
   down between the shelves. The trapdoor is {NEAR.TRAP}.
#
PLACE +ROOF, TOWER.ROOF
   You're on the tower roof by the {ROOF.TRAP} trapdoor.
  %You are on the square tower roof. The roof is quite flat
   and has no rail or balustrade. Near the center is a rather
   rusty trapdoor, currently {ROOF.TRAP}. However, the most 
   note-worthy feature of this place is the commanding view over the
   surrounding forest. To the north you can see a forest track,
   which starts from a small enclosed garden at the foot of the 
   tower, runs through the forest, bending to NW and finally 
   disappears over a steep hill. To the east, the forest marches
   into the distance, but to the south the ground becomes quite
   broken by some ravines and a somewhat romantic crag or two.
   To the west the forest stops abruptly, giving way to the blue 
   surface of the sea, which reaches all the way to the horizon.
#
PLACE SHELVES.WEST
   You're at the top of of the shelves at their western end.
  %You are at the top of the shelves by the western wall above
   the door, awkwardly straddling the passage between the two racks. 
   Just above you are the beams of the  ceiling. {DISTANT.TRAP}
#
PLACE TOWER.TOP.WINDOW
   You are at a window part way up a flight of stone steps.
  %You are at a window part way up a flight of stone steps. The view is
   quite beautiful - below you is a cliff, an enraged sea battering at
   its base.[ As if to match the scene, some angry sounding voices
   can be heard from above./]
#
PLACE TOWER.TOP.LANDING
   You are on the top landing.
  %You are on the top landing of the tower stairs. To the east
   is a[ closed/n open] door, bearing the stern
   notice: '%DWARVES QUARTERS - NO ACCESS%'.[/ Through the door you can
   see a large table covered with dirty dishes, pewter mugs and
   and earthenware jugs.] A wooden stool stands by the door.
#
PLACE DWARVES.QUARTERS
   You are in dwarves quarters.
  %You are in a semi-circular room, which seems to serve as dwarves'
   quarters. Most of the room is occupied by an oblong wooden table,
   largely covered in dirty dishes, empty pewter jugs and empty
   earthenware jugs. To the east, a large window overlooks
   an endless forest vista. [To the west is a closed door/An open door
   leads west, to the top stairs landing].
#
PLACE +TRACK, +TRACKS
   You're on a forest track.
  %You are standing at a curve on a wide forest track amidst a
   dense forest, which looks particularly dark to west and northwest.
   The track climbs up a steep hill to the east, while to the
   southwest it winds its way through the forest, vaguely in the
   direction of a white tower, that can be seen above the trees.
#
PLACE OUTSIDE.GATES
   You're outside the garden gates.
  %You are standing at the end of a track which winds its way to the
   north through the dense forest. The progress south is blocked by
   wrought iron gates set in a tall stone wall. Through the gates you
   can see the white tower at the back of some sort of a garden
   in a state of bad neglect. The dense forest grows right up to the
   wall, offering no prospect of exploring to either side along it.

   A notice by the gates reads

  +                "NO ADMITTANCE"
  +       "TRESPASSERS WILL BE PERSECUTED"

#
#
PLACE GARDEN.N      # Remember, gates are schizoid!
   You're in the rose garden by the gates.
  %You are at the grand entrance to the badly neglected garden. 
   A wide path lined by a tangled profusion of wild roses, leads
   south towards a large white tower, while narrower paths run southeast
   and southwest. Intricately worked wrought iron gates lead north, out
   of the garden to a forest track.
#
PLACE GARDEN.NW
   You're in the NW corner of the rose garden.
  %You are in the northwest corner of the garden, in a circular area, 
   formed by dead rose bushes. Four weathered stone pedestals form a 
   square within the circular space.{SQUARE.CIRCLE} A narrow path
   leads into a tangle of wild roses to the south.
#
PLACE +GARDEN, GARDEN.NE
   You're in the NE corner of the rose garden.
  %You are in the northeast corner of the garden, under the tall garden
   walls. The remains of a wooden pergola can be seen here, submerged
   under the tangled mass of wild roses. A narrow path leads south.
#
PLACE GARDEN.SW
   You're in the SW corner of the rose garden.
  %You are in the southwest corner of the garden, in the shadow of the
   white tower. The whole place is surrounded by a dense tangle of
   prickly growth, but two narrow paths offer a somewhat scratchy way
   north and northeast. If there ever was a way east, it is completely
   overgrown now. A stone bench stands here, inviting one to a lazy rest
   in the cool shadow.
#
PLACE GARDEN.S
   You're at the foot of the tower.
  %You are at the foot of the white tower. The lower part of the tower
   wall is covered by an ancient growth of ivy. 
   A small, tasteful bronze plaque is affixed to the tower wall.
   A wide path surrounded by a tangle of wild roses, runs north,
   towards large ornamental gates. It would seem that narrower paths
   used to lead east and west, but they have been completely filled 
   by the prickly mass of roses gone wild.
#
PLACE GARDEN.SE
   You're in the SE corner of the rose garden.
  %You are in the southeast corner of the garden, by an overgrown
   ornamental fountain. The fountain itself clearly stopped working
   long ago, but its stone basin is full of surprisingly clean rain water.
   The whole place is surrounded by a prickly tangle of roses gone wild,
   with just a narrow path leading northwest and a small opening just
   possibly offering an exit north.
#
PLACE DUNGEON.EXIT
   You're in the earthen passage under the dungeon.
  %You are at the top end of a winding earthen passage which 
   slopes down to the south. The lower end of the passage seems to
   become rather narrow and damp. Just above you is a 
   hole leading into the giant's dungeon.
#
PLACE WELL.BOTTOM
   You're in the disused well.
  %You are in a small circular chamber which appears to be the
   bottom of a disused well. Looking up, towards a patch of 
   daylight, you can see that the walls of the well are
   damp and crumbling, but should be reasonably easy to
   climb. An earthen passage leads back to the north.
#
PLACE CRYPT
   You're in the crypt.
  %You are in a crypt. All around you are the tombs of people long
   dead. The dust on the vaults would seem to indicate that the
   place is rarely used. High above you massive cobwebs almost cover
   the ceiling. The spiral staircase leading up is the only
   exit. Brrr! It is really chilly down here!

  %You are in the chamber above the entrance to the chapel. A spiral
   staircase leads down, openings lead to the north and west and an
   arched doorway leads south.[

   // ]Above the doorway 
   is [{SOMETHING.FISHY}/a small red fire alarm box].

  %You are at the northern end of a long low attic. A passage leads on to
   the north.
#
PLACE +DEN
   You're in the thieves den.
  %This must be a thieves den!  There is a large shelf on one wall,
   labelled 'SWAG'. A hand-written note is pinned to the wall just 
   above the shelf.
#
PLACE +PANTRY
   You're in the pantry.
  %You are in a room which shows signs of having been used as a
   pantry. The dust on the shelves would seem to indicate that it
   has had little use. The walls are damp and there is a stream
   of water running down the walls in one corner. Passages lead to
   the east, northeast and west. From an archway to the north,
   stone steps lead down.
#
PLACE UNSAFE
   You're in the unsafe passage.
  %You are in a long north/south passage whose roof is supported in places
   by wooden props. Some of the props have recently been replaced with
   new timber, but fresh rock falls are also apparent. One of these falls
   has exposed a fracture in the west wall which you may be able to
   squeeze through.
#
PLACE VERY.UNSAFE
   You're at the end of the very unsafe tunnel.
  %A smell of decaying timber fills this part of the passage. To the
   north the passage is blocked by a larger than usual rock fall and the
   whole passage looks as if it could collapse at any moment.
#
PLACE LOW.ROOM
   You're in the very low room.
  %You are in a very low sloping room whose roof is barely 3' from the
   floor. At the lower end a trickle of water enters from a tunnel in
   the west and runs down a shaft in the floor. At the upper end the roof
   nearly meets the floor to give a narrow exit. Water drips from the
   roof making everything damp and the floor slippery. There are no signs
   that anyone has been this way before and the feeling of awe and
   expectancy apparent elsewhere in the cave, is strangely absent here.
#
PLACE BONES.ROOM
   You're in the bones room.
  %The passage opens into a sizable cave which does not appear to have any
   other exit although a number of huge bones lie here. Close inspection
   shows that they are very old and are covered with strange score marks
   which look to be fairly recent. There are also some droppings which   
   might have been made by rats if they weren't so large. 
#
FRAGMENT INCLINED.SHAFT
   You're in the inclined shaft
#
FRAGMENT SLIMY.SHAFT
   You are in an inclined shaft which steepens at this point. The walls
   are covered in a thin layer of slime making them very slippery. Below
   you the shaft
#
PLACE PHONEY.SHAFT
   {INCLINED.SHAFT} above dark smelly water.
  %{SLIMY.SHAFT} is filled with dark water that surges rhythmically. The
   smell of the sea is mingled with an altogether more unpleasant odour.
#
PLACE IN.SHAFT
   {INCLINED.SHAFT} above the north/south culvert.
  %{SLIMY.SHAFT} steepens and enters a north/south culvert partially
   filled with a brackish, evil smelling liquid. You could slide down 
   here but you could not climb back up.
#
PLACE SEA.VIEW
   You're at the sea-view.
  %The sea can be seen through a strong metal grill which spans the
   tunnel. A quantity of debris is stacked against the grill and pieces
   of debris are caught in the grill nearly to the roof. High on the
   opposite side of the sewage-filled culvert is a line scored into 
   the brick-work with a faded ornate inscription above it which reads:

  +         "CAUTION - HIGH TIDE LEVEL!"

#
PLACE +CULVERT
   You're in the north/south culvert.
  %The brick culvert goes north and south and seems to narrow to the
   south.
#
PLACE CULVERT.SOUTH
   You are at the south end of the culvert.
  %Sewage pours into the culvert from a large number of sewage pipes of
   all sizes. Those entering from the east, southeast, south, southwest,
   west and northwest are large enough to crawl through. The culvert
   exits to the north.

   west wall is closed by some heavy curtains hanging on its other side.
#
PLACE LOW.PASSAGE
   You're in the low, long passage.
  %You are in a low, long passage that appears to have been made by some
   subterranean water source. The passage itself is of bare rock polished
   smooth by the water that apparently flows no longer, for the floor and
   walls are quite dry. It heads north, bending out of sight to the right,
   and south, where it widens to a small cavern.
#
PLACE LARGE.CAVERN
   You're in the large cavern.
  %You are in a large cavern, the roof of which extends higher than the beam of
   your lamp can penetrate. A passage leads southwest and bends to the

   the cavern through a large opening, obscuring whatever might lie beyond.
#
PLACE SWIRLING.MIST
   You're in the swirling mist.
  %You are in the middle of a swirling mist that eddies to and fro around

#
PLACE END.OF.VALLEY
   You're at the end of the valley.
  %You are at the end of a deep valley which suddenly runs into a steep
   jumble of rock. A profusion of vicious looking brambles and nettles,

PLACE ISLAND.NE
   You are by the stream, on the northeast side of the island.
  %The beach of golden sand, which stretches to the northwest and
   to the southeast, is interrupted here by a jumble of rocks fallen
   from a weathered volcanic outcrop to the southwest. A rushing 
   stream, most likely responsible for the rockfall, finds it way
   through the jumble to the sea. The footing may be a touch tricky,
   but you should have no trouble passing through here.
#

  %You are standing some way up the western outcrop of the mountain
   which descends to a golden beach to the west. The calm blue sea
   stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, sparkling in the sun.
   The outcrop climbs steeply to the east, but
   there also appears to be a less steep way around the mountain
   to the southeast.
#
PLACE ISLAND.02
   You are by the wooded mountain fold.{HALF.HIDDEN.SHOES}
  %You are standing on the edge of a deep mountain fold, filled
   with trees and bushes, which block any progress eastwards around
   the mountain. The slopes above and below are full of
   unstable-looking rocks. The only relatively safe way appears
   to lead down to the northwest.{HALF.HIDDEN.SHOES}
#
PLACE ISLAND.03
   You are on the western slopes of the mountain.
  %You are on the western slopes of the mountain, high above the
   sea. A narrow golden beach can be seen far below you. It is
   much cooler here and the vegetation is more in keeping
   with the altitude, tending more to scruffy pines than palms.
   A steep but climbable slope leads down to the west, and you may
   be able to make your way up around the mountain to the northeast,
   or head somewhat down to the south.
#
PLACE ISLAND.04
   You are on the mountain, above the large swamp-filled area.
  %You are on a southern shoulder of the mountain, which appears
   to be a low and well weathered wall of a large volcanic crater.
   Somewhat below you, under a short but sheer drop 
   to the east and northeast, the old
   caldera is filled by a poisonously green swamp. A stream, clearly
   responsible for the boggy conditions, cascades off the distant
   mountain slope to the north, in a series of small waterfalls.
   The swamp is inaccessible from here, but there is an easy slope
   leading upwards to the northwest and down to the golden beach
   to the southeast.

   You are on the north side of mountain ravine.
  %[The trail has bent sharply west, into a deep and narrow
   ravine which cuts into the side of the mountain.
   Once upon a time, at its westernmost point there presumably
   was some ledge or bridge, allowing one access to the south side
   of the ravine, but nothing at all remains now.

  %The trail opens up here to a flat area in front of a small 
   marble temple, which nestles against the mountain slope. To the
   east you get a splendid view of the romantically wild mountain 
   terrain below, where a rapid stream can be seen rushing over 
   large rocks in a narrow gorge. Further out is the island beach,
   the sparkling sea in the distance, the white cliffs of the 
   mainland far off to the east. Below you to the south you can see the
   edge of a great swamp which fills the remnants of the ancient 
   volcanic caldera.
#
PLACE ISLAND.07
   You are on the northern shoulder of the mountain.
  %You are on the north shoulder of the mountain, which rises
   from the northwest to the southeast. The reddish soil is
   almost entirely free of vegetation, which makes for easy
   progress. To the east, the ground gives way suddenly, with
   nothing much to be seen except the blue sea and some white
   cliffs far in the distance. The mountain rises steeply above
   you to the west and southwest.
#
PLACE ISLAND.08
   You are on the northeast side of the mountain.
  %You are high on the northeast side of the mountain, above
   a large expanse of the blue sea. A level trail leads
   northwest into a dense mass of scruffy-looking firs, while to the
   south it turns sharply to the right into a deep ravine
   which cuts into the mountainside. An easy
   slope descends to the north along a reddish shoulder of the
   mountain, which is surprisingly free of vegetation. Faint sounds of a 
   rushing stream can be heard from the east where the
   down slope gets progressively steeper - if you climb down
   there you may not be able to get back up again. 
#
PLACE ISLAND.09
   You are on the NW slope of the mountain.
  %You are standing amidst some firs clinging to the slopes,
   high on the northwest side of the mountain. The trees
   block all view except of the mountain peak rising above you
   to the southeast. Some kind of animal trail runs down to
   southwest in one direction and levels off to the east in the
   other.

  %You are in the temple. Inside it consists of a single circular room
   with a smooth marble floor and columns all around the periphery. There
   are small circular windows placed between the columns near the vaulted
   ceiling. They let in daylight which diffuses through this place, giving
   it an airy lightness, despite its rather small size.[//// In the

FRAGMENT STREAM.BANKS.1
   To the east the upward slope of the bank
   is covered by an impenetrable tangle of vegetation. To the west
   the crumbling rock, undercut by the stream, offers
   an uncertain and possibly risky way upwards.
#
PLACE BY.STREAM.1
   You are by the mountain stream.
  %You are at the side of a stream which flows from the south to
   the north, towards the sea. The stream is full of rocks and
   larger boulders, so you can follow it quite easily, striding or
   jumping from rock to rock, even though there is no continuous path
   along the stream. {STREAM.BANKS.1}
#
PLACE BY.STREAM.2
   You are at the bend in the mountain stream.
  %You are balancing on wet boulders at the bend in the small gorge
   cut by the stream, which flows from NW to NE. 
#
PLACE BOG.EDGE
   You are at the NE edge of the swamp.
  %You are standing on some water-worn boulders under a sheer
   cliff. To the west of you stretches a large boggy area
   covered with lush, poisonously green vegetation. This is where
   the otherwise stagnant waters of the swamp drain off, over and
   through chunks of rock fallen from above, and into a small
   gorge to the southeast. The stream flow soon becomes turbulent,
   but a large number of stones and boulders through which it has
   to pick its way, should allow passage through the
   gorge. A narrow crack in the rock above you, seems to offer
   some opportunities for a fairly easy climb upwards.
#
PLACE +VIEWPOINT
   You are at the viewpoint above the caldera.
  %You are on a small NW-facing rock shelf, from where you get a
   splendid bird's-eye view of the ancient caldera 
   filled by the swamp. You could climb down again, the way you 
   came, or you could scramble over the low ridge to the east.
#
PLACE VIEWPOINT.2
   You are at the viewpoint above the sea.
  %You are on a fairly flat platform of weathered rock, above a
   magnificent vista to the east, where the overgrown mountain
   slopes to a narrow golden beach, with the deep blue sea beyond,
   stretching to a line of white cliffs near the horizon. The only
   proper exit is to the west over a small stony ridge, but as you
   look over the eastern edge  of this rock platform you can see
   a track running just a couple of meters below -- you could 
   easily jump down to it.
#
PLACE +RIDGE
   You are at the edge of the marsh.
  %You are on a low ridge somewhat above the level of
   a large flat area enclosed by the southern and the eastern
   shoulders of the mountain. The lush vegetation which covers
   the area is of a different type from the plants growing around
   you on the ridge and suggests that you are actually looking
   at a dangerous swamp. Further northwest rises the mountain
   itself and you can just make out cascades of several 
   waterfalls clearly responsible for the existence of the swamp.
   To the southeast, the ground slopes down to a sandy beach.
   You could also scramble down to the swamp from here, but if you
   do, you won't be able to climb back up.
#
PLACE BELOW.RIDGE
   You are at the SE edge of the swamp.
  %You are below a steep bank, at the southeast edge of the swamp,
   which stretches in front of you to the north and northwest.
   The area just below the bank is a bit muddy and largely covered
   with grass, but a bit further out the flat area of the swamp is
   overgrown by a profusion of leafy, water-loving plants, with
   just an occasional scrubby bush holding on to a drier patch of
   soil. Here and there, small areas of open water can be glimpsed
   through the greenery. A rich smell of decaying vegetation
   hangs in the motionless air.
#
PLACE +CALDERA, CRATER
   You are on the NW edge of the swamp.
  %You are on the north-westerly edge of the swamp. Above you,
   weathered cliffs rise to the sky. Chunks of rock fallen from
   above offer a tricky but firm footing. A short distance to the
   northeast, a small waterfall cascades noisily into the swamp.
   Looking to either side along the cliff, you can see several
   other such waterfalls, leaping down the rocks from far above.
#
PLACE BY.WATERFALL
   You are by the waterfall.
  %You are standing on the northwest edge of the swamp,
   in front of a small waterfall, cascading off the cliffs that
   tower above you. Due to the water being endlessly supplied
   by the waterfall, the swamp around here is far too watery
   to allow passage. The only obvious exit is to southwest, along
   the cliffs, where accumulated chunks of fallen rock allow
   reasonably safe passage to a somewhat drier looking area.
#
PLACE +WATERFALL
   You are behind the waterfall.
  %You are under a rock overhang, behind the waterfall. 
   The debris covered floor is quite wet from water spray, but
   otherwise it is not as wet here as one might expect.

   You are in the chamber by the stone table.
  %The tunnel opens up here into a small irregular chamber,
   with the only exit leading SE.
   At the far wall of the chamber is a large chunk of rock, shaped
   to resemble a kind of stone table, its sides artfully crafted
   to look like folds of a heavy table-cloth hanging down to the
   ground.
#
PLACE MINE.EXIT
   You are at the mine's upper exit.
  %The tunnel coming from the northeast, narrows down here to a 
   mere crawl and ends in a narrow opening to the south. The
   opening is filled with foliage, but some amount of daylight
   filters through from the outside. Parting the foliage, you can 
   see that the tunnel comes out on a steep mountain slope, covered with
   vegetation. You could get out here, and hope to get down the
   slope without a serious injury, but if you do, you won't be
   able to come back up again.

   western end.

   From the NE you can clearly hear the sound of rushing 
   water brought by a constant cool breeze.

#
#
FRAGMENT RUSHING.RIVER
   This is a large low cave, cut across by a wide stream
   of water which swirls past you in a turbulent, foam-speckled flow
#
PLACE CAVE.5
   You are on the northern bank of the underground river.
  %{RUSHING.RIVER} and dives at great speed under rocks to the west.
   The peculiar membrane bridge stretches over the water from here to
   the southern shore. A dark passage slopes upwards to the north,
   and you could also walk east, upstream along the river.
#
PLACE CAVE.4
   You are on the southern bank of the underground river.
  %{RUSHING.RIVER}, just below the level of the 
   tunnel entrance, and dives at great speed under rocks to the west.
   Something that looks vaguely like a bridge stretches from here
   to the northern shore where another opening can be seen in
   the cave wall. A wide passage leads SW and you could also
   walk east, upstream along the river.
#
PLACE CAVE.6
   You are in the dark north/south corridor.
  %You are in a narrow corridor, climbing gently from the south
   to the north.
#
PLACE CAVE.7
   You are in the low round cave.
  %You are in a low round room with a slightly concave floor. The only
   exit leads south.
#
PLACE +RIVER
   You are on the southern shore of the underground river.
  %You are walking along a rock shelf along
   the southern shore of the underground river. At this point the shelf
   disappears in the turbulent, foam-flecked waters of the river, making
   any further progress upstream quite impossible.
#
PLACE RIVER.NORTH
   You are on the northern shore of the underground river.
  %You are walking along a rock shelf stretching east and west along
   the northern shore of the underground river. The turbulent
   waters of the river rush past you, just inches below the edge of the
   rock.
#
PLACE CAVE.9
   You are on the northern river shore.
  %You are standing on a narrow rock shelf stretching east and west along
   the northern shore of the underground river. The foam-flecked
   waters of the river rush past you, just inches below the edge of the
   rock. A sort of deep hum can be heard from upstream.
#
FRAGMENT IMPS.WATERFALL
   River waters fall down from somewhere above, where your feeble light
   cannot reach, in a continuous, glass-smooth sheet. Despite the
   massive amount of the falling water, it does not make all that much noise. 
#
PLACE CAVE.8
   You are at the waterfall on the northern shore of the underground river.
  %You are standing at the foot of a most peculiar 
   waterfall. {IMPS.WATERFALL} More like a loud continuous hum, with an
   occasional splashing sound thrown in. The only exit is west, back
   where you came from.
#
PLACE STEPS.TO.ABYSS
   You are at the top of the square shaft.
  %[The corridor ends here, but there is a narrow square shaft
   leading down. A closer inspection shows rough footholds cut
   into one of the shaft's walls. The only other exit/
   You are by the top exit from the narrow square shaft. A
   dark corridor] leads SW. It would appear that a short inscription,
   had been once cut into the wall above the 
   shaft's opening. Unfortunately the wall's surface has crumbled away
   and what remains of the inscription is mostly illegible.
#
PLACE SQUARE.SHAFT.BOTTOM
   You are at the bottom of the square shaft.
  %You are at the end of a roughly cut tunnel leading east. Hand-holds
   cut into the northern wall allow access to a narrow square hole
   above you.
#
PLACE +ABYSS
   You are at the edge of the abyss.
  %You are standing on a small platform thrusting eastwards into
   void. The only visible wall is to the west, where a dark
   tunnel can be seen leading away, into the rock. The wall extends
   into the the darkness, north and south, with no visible limits.
   Not far above your head, a rough rock ceiling stretches
   away to the east as far as your light allows you to see. Below is
   a featureless black abyss.
#
FRAGMENT ABYSS.SHORT
   You are standing in mid-air above black abyss.
#
FRAGMENT ABYSS.LONG
   You are standing in mid-air over a vast black abyss. To the west
   you can just about discern a rock wall plunging into the darkness
   below, and a short distance above is the uneven stone ceiling, full
   of hollows and protruding rocks. All else is impenetrable darkness.

   vast abyss. [Looking down, you notice that there seem to be some 
   pin-pricks of light scattered through the darkness below. They look 
   remarkably like stars. Startled, you realise that incredible though it
   is, they *are* stars. Amazed you look up, towards the rough stone ceiling
   just a short distance above you, and then down again - and a sudden 
   wave of nausea hits you, as your perception flips the world around. 
   It feels like you are hanging upside down in mid-air, not far from
   the stony ground, under a starry sky. Shutting your eyes helps. After
   a while the direction of gravity reasserts itself as "down", and you
   are once again able to look around without getting too queasy./

   rough stone ceiling stretches into the darkness in all directions.]

   and replaced at random, to make pseudo-mazes look more realistic.
   Exits lead in all directions.
#
PLACE +LIMBO
#  Limbo is the normal holding area for objects that aren't
#  currently visible in the cave. All special objects
#  (dwarf, pirate, axe, treasure chest, pearl, etc) start
#  out here and are moved to the appropriate places in the
#  cave at the proper times. The nest of golden eggs
#  ends up here the first time you give it to the troll
#  and may be fetched back to the Giant room with the
#  Fee Fie Foe Foo sequence;  the second time you try to
#  give it to the troll it ends up in Ylem (q.v.) and
#  can't be gotten back. The Oyster starts out here and
#  is swapped with the Clam when you succeed in opening the
#  clam with the trident. Needless to say, there is no
#  way that the adventurer should be able to get to Limbo
#  (unless he is a wizard using the master-mode commands)
#  since he could do all kinds of nasty things here (get the
#  batteries without paying the coins, get the rug without
#  first killing the dragon, move the clam to the house, etc.)  Very nasty!
#
   You are in Limbo.
  %You are in Limbo, a place outside the game, full of things awaiting
   their incarnation in the game. There are also other shadowy presences
   lurking about, mostly invisible to the eye, with no hope of ever
   leaving this strange place. The only exit is OUT.

#
PLACE +YLEM
#
#  Ylem must be the last place defined (following Limbo). It is
#  intended as a trash-can place - objects moved to Ylem are
#  forever inaccessible (coding convention only - no enforcement
#  by the handlers). Ylem is also used in the fall-to-a-painful-death
#  logic (label SPLATTER and a couple of miscellaneous calls also)
#  so that if you fall from someplace and would end up lying dead at
#  some location that isn't really defined (the bottom of the chasm,
#  in the volcanic gorge, etc) the things you were carrying get
#  deposited here.
#
   You are in Ylem.
  %You are in Ylem, the final resting place of objects and beings in
   Adventure4. Naturally enough, there are no exits. You knew how to
   teleport in here, so you should know how to teleport out again.
