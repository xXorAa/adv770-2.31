                        A-code kernel version 12.89
                        ===========================

 The kernel consists simlpy of ANSI C sources of the A-code C kernel
 (adv00.c, adv01.c and adv0.h). These get compiled and linked with the C
 source files created by the <i>acdc translator from A-code sources.

 The other stuff (acode.html, libtest.c, sortxrefs and the extras
 subdirectory) are used by the <i>advbld script for more complex builds.

 For more information, please see the supplied A-code documentation.

 The NEWS file contains details of A-code changes in this version.
