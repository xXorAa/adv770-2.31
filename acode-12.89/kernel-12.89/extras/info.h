"This interface can be used entirely from the keyboard, as long as the "
"command input field remains in focus. Commands can be submitted by pressing "
"the RETURN key. The command field is in fact a combo-box, so you can edit "
"and submit your earlier commands."

"The game has persistent state, which means that you do not need to save "
"your current session using in-game save and restore commands (though you can "
"do that too). The game's current state is automatically saved for you "
"every time you are prompted for a command. Thus you can simply close the "
"game via CtrlQ and the next time you decide to play, it will restart at "
"the same point. "

"Modified settings will persist over game invocations, but you can "
