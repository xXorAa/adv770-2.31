                                   Adv770
                                Version 2.31

 This directory contains the source of my 770 points version of Adventure.
 The game, generally known as Adv770, is licenced under GPL3 (or later) (see
 the accompanying LICENCE file) and may be freely distributed and archived.

 Included are both the A-code sources of the game (the *.acd files). If all
 you want to do is to look at the game's source, just ignore everything
 else.

 For your convenience, the sub-directory C contains ANSI C source derived by
 the acdc translator from the supplied A-code source, plus the three A-code
 kernel source files (adv00.c, adv01.c and adv0.h). You can build a basic
 game executable simply by compiling and linking these C sources using any
 ANSI C compiler: 'cc *.c -o adv770 -lreadline' or, if you don't have the
 readline library installed, 'cc *.c -o adv770 -DNO_READLINE'. By default
 the executable will use your default browser, but you can use the -C
 command line option to force basic console display instead.

 Also included is A-code documentation and sources of A-code utilities I use
 on Linux, Unix or MacOS to build adv770 executable in various modes.

 Please see HTML documentation in the doc sub-directory for general
 information on building A-code game executables, as well as full A-code
 language documentation.

 To save you the trouble, https://mipmip.org/adv770/ offers pre-built
 bundles for Linux, Mac, MSDOS and Windows, as well as an HTML/JavaScript
 version which runs under any HTML5 compliant browser.

 If you do find any bugs, however small, please consult the Adv770 bug list
 https://www.mipmip.org/adv770/bugs.html and if appropriate, report the bug
 to me at mla@mipmip.org. For more A-code information, please visit my
 web-site:

 Hope you enjoy the game!
