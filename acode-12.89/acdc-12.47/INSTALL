                        A-code to ANSI C translator
                               Version 12.47
                     =================================

 Because the acdc translator does nothing more then read some files and
 write some files, it has no special dependencies and can be built using any
 ANSI C compiler (e.g. gcc or clang) simply by compiling and linking all
 supplied sources.

 On a Unix-like system (Unix, Linux, MacOS) this can be done by the single
 command

                               cc -o acdc *.c

 If using the advbld script, if the executable is absent, it is built
 automatically.
